### Definition
>[!cite] Resistance Ω
>*Resistance*, measured in ***Ohms*** (*Ω*), is the *measure* of the **difficulty of passing a [[Current]] through a [[Circuit]] / substance**. 
>
*According to [[Ohm's Law]]*
>$R=\frac{V}{I}$
>Where:
>R = *Resistance*
>V = [[Voltage]]
>I = [[Current]]

#### Explanation 
The more *Resistance* the less Electricity can pass through the [[Circuit]].
A [[Current]] will always take the **path of *least resistance***.

It relates to Voltage and Current, ***probably*** because the voltage is the pressure on the electrons that is trying to push them through, and the current is the rate of flow, dividing the two gives  you the resistance since the missing element in that equation is how much the **substance** / [[Circuit]] is ***resisting*** the *flow of electrons*, which is a long form way of saying the **resistance**. (***maybe***)
