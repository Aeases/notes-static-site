#### Definition
>[!cite] Work
>Work, measured in [[Joule]]s is found by multiplying force over a displacement of distance. $W=F \times d$, *Work itself is the [[Energy]] (in joules) that has been excerted over a distance, irrespective of the Energy Type.*
>
>W = Work, F = Force,* d = Displacement*
>
>Sometimes expressed as $W=Fs$

$$Work=\text{Force}\times\text{Displacement}$$
