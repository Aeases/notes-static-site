### Definition
>[!cite] Voltage
>Voltage is the "*Pressure*" that pushes the electrons throughout a circuit, No Voltage, No Current as it is not pushed through.
>
>*According to [[Ohm's Law]]*
>$V=$ [[Current|I]] $\times$ [[Resistance|R]]

$$\text{Voltage} = \text{Current} \times \text{Resistance}$$

#### Voltage Difference
The difference in voltage between the **positive** side and the **negative** side is another way of seeing the voltage of a [[Circuit]].
![[Voltage Difference.excalidraw]]

>[!warning] personal theory
>Does the circuit work because the positive side is attracting everything in the [[Circuit]] towards it, this is probably also why batteries run out of charge because all the electrons have been attracted to the positive side of the "battery" in the [[Voltage Difference.excalidraw|diagram above]].
>Makes sense since the *voltage*, also described as the pressure is the difference,  between the positive and negative which is probably the magnetic force that pulls them along, aka the voltage,
