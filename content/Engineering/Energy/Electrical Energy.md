### Definition
>[!cite] Electrical Energy
>Electrical Energy is in the format of Kilowatt Hours, and measures how many kilowatts are used in an our in that format.
>
>$E_e=$ [[Voltage|V]] $\times$ [[Current|I]] $\times$ t
>Or $E_e=$ [[Power|P]] $\times$ t
>Where:
>V is the [[Voltage]] of the circuit
>**I** is the [[Current]] Travelling through the circuit
>T is the time that the circuit has been operating
>R is the [[Resistance]]

$$\text{Electrical Energy} = \text{Voltage} \times \text{Current} \times \text{time}$$
Or:
$$\text{Electrical Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{time}$$
