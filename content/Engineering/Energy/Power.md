### Definition
>[!cite] Power
>Power is a measure of *Energy Transferred* or *Work Done* per unit of time. It is used to 
>
>The formula $P=E/t$ can be used for any type of power (double check for mechanical power).

$P=E/t$
**P** = Power ([[Watt]])
**E** = Energy Transfer ([[Joule]])
**t** = Time in Seconds

## Electrical Power
>[!cite] Electrical Power
>Power, in the context of *Electricity*, is measured in [[Watt]]s, and tells us how many [[Joule]]s are transferred per second, Higher power, more energy is being used per-second.

$P=V\times I$ *you can also sub in voltage formula $P=I^2 \times R$*
Where:
P = **Electrical Power**
V = [[Voltage]]
I = [[Current]]



## Mechanical Power
>[!cite] Mechanical Power
>Mechanical Power, measured in Watts, measures  

$$P=WD \div T$$


>[!example] Example - If a bulb uses 60kJ of energy in 10 minutes, what is the power rating of the bulb?
>$P=\frac{E}{t}$
>=$60,000/(10\times60)$
>=$60,000/600$
>=$100$ [[Watt]]

>[!note] Practise
>A winch lifts a 500 kg pallet of bricks to a height of 10 m in a time of 15 seconds. Calculate the minimum output power of the lift.
