## Engineering design process
##### Investigating
- develop a comprehensive design brief
- identify and assess existing solutions or similar products that are identified using a variety of research
skills
- research and critique materials and components relevant to the design brief
- consider different and appropriate sources of energy
Devising
- produce annotated pictorial drawings of design ideas
- produce annotated orthographic drawings of design ideas
- analyse and justify the choice of option to be used as the solution
Producing
- present specifications for the selected solution
    - dimensioned pictorial and orthographic drawings
    - orthographic drawings and sketches are 3rd angle projections and include
o lines – outlines, hidden detail and centerlines
o dimensioning – linear, radii, circles, holes through or partial depth with flat base
    - list and/or descriptions of selected materials with justification of choices
    - parts lists
    - costing of prototype or working model

- develop and use a timeline for construction and testing of solution
- construct solutions by selecting and using appropriate tools and machines and by following safe work
practices
- test the solution for correct function and document using checklists and test data
Evaluating
- evaluate the final solution in terms of:
    - meeting the requirements of the design brief
    - safety, function and finish of product
    - modifications and changes to the design and processes during production
    - refinements and changes for future development
Materials
- define physical properties of materials
    - density
    - elasticity
    - plasticity
    - strength – tensile and compressive
    - stiffness
    - toughness
    - ductility
    - malleability
    - conductivity – electrical and thermal
    - corrosion resistance
- fitness for purpose
    - identify and justify the required properties of a material for a specified application

## Fundamental engineering calculations

###### Volume
- cubes, rectangular right prisms and triangular right prisms
- cylinders
    - V = Ξr
2
h
- spheres
    - V = 4
/3 Ξr
3
Density
- (measured in kg m-3
)
Quantity estimates
- determine volume, mass and density of geometric forms
    - individual or simple combinations
    - hollow or solid

###### Energy
- $E = Pt$
- 1 joule = 1 watt x 1 second
- 1 kW h = 1000 watts x 1 hour
###### Efficiency
- calculate efficiency as a percentage = x 100
Unfamiliar formula
- determine an unknown factor in unfamiliar formula given sufficient data to complete the calculation

## Engineering in society
##### Life cycle analysis of engineered products
- the stages of the life cycle
    - materials acquisition
    - processing materials
    - manufacture
    - packaging
    - transport
    - maintenance/operation
    - reuse/recycle/disposal
- impacts for society, business and the environment that occur during the life cycle of engineered
products

## Specialist engineering fields
### Mechanical
##### Materials
- define Factor of Safety (FS) as the ratio of ultimate failure stress to safe working stress
- use the formula to determine one unknown variable
    - Factor of Safety: $$\text{Factor of Safety (FS)}= \frac{\sigma_{LTS}}{\sigma_\text{safeworking}}$$
##### Statics
- calculate second moment of area for material cross-sections
    - vertical rectangular solid section $$I_{XX}=\frac{bh^3}{12}$$
    - round solid section $$I_{xx}=\frac{\pi D^4}{64}$$
    - circular tube section $$I_{xx}=\frac{\pi(D^4_{o})-D_{i}^4}{64}$$
### Deflection of beams
- calculate one unknown variable using one of the four beam deflection formulae
- deflection scenarios, when solving for ‘$y$’, are to be calculated in isolation and a maximum of t wo load
scenarios in total may be combined to give the final deflection sum
Note 1 – Second moment of area (Ixx) values for differing beam cross-sections beyond the three
specified under the ‘Second moment of area’ heading can be directly provided for use in deflection
calculations.
Note 2 – Maximum bending moment calculations are only to be dealt with in the context of bending
moment diagram problems – not in deflection questions.
    - cantilevered beam with a single load at its unsupported end $$y=\frac{FL^3}{3EI_{xx}}$$
    - cantilevered beam with a universally distributed load along the whole length of the beam (can be self-weight of beam) $$y=\frac{F_{UDL}L^3}{8EI_{xx}}$$
    - centrally loaded beam simply supported at both ends $$\frac{FL^3}{48EI_{xx}}$$
    - universally loaded beam, simply supported at both ends. The UDL is spread along the whole length of the beam (can be self-weight of beam) $$y=\frac{5F_{UDL}L^3}{384EI_{xx}}$$
## Method of Sections
- use the $\Sigma CWM = \Sigma ACWM$ formula to determine the reaction forces at the supports of horizontal, simply supported pin-jointed trusses, where all external forces are vertical
- calculate the forces in no more than three members in a simple pin-jointed truss by using the method of sections. Sectioning lines shall remain straight whilst crossing the maximum three members. The moment arm, not the force, shall be the variable requiring trigonometry in determining any particular moment required. All external forces are to be vertical only
