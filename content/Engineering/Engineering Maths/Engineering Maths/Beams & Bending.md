### Types of Supports


##### Fixed Support
Fixed supports can provide a reaction from a force from almost any angle (along the axis, or from directly above), therefore, if the angle is not directly horizontal or vertical, we can [[Resolution of Forces|resolve]] the angle into it's vertical and horizontal components.

>Fixed supports can have **two unknown (resolved) reaction forces**, 

##### Roller Support
A Roller applies very little resistance to forces applied along the axis of the beam (horizontally), if you applied a force there the roller would probably roll or something.

>Roller supports only have one unknown reaction force, one applied directly purpendicular

##### Cantilever's Embedded Support
Cantilevers are embeded in a material, thus they resist forces horizontal and vertical forces like a Fixed Support, but also have a moment that prevents rotation since they are embeded.

- On the bending moment graph, it is pretty much always *negative*, th 
	- This is unlike the other B.M graphs where if the Shear Force Diagram is postiive, then the B.M graph is also positive.




### Types of Loads

##### Concentrated Loads


##### Uniformally Distributed Loads
Loads distributed uniformally  can be represented as a single force at the centrepoint, with the Kn/m value turned into kN 
e.g. 
- 4m long U.D.L 
- That applies a load of 5kN/m
  = 20kN at it's midpoint

On a [[Shear Force Diagram]], the left most side of the UDL is the start of a linear line going to the right most side, **even though there is a force acting in the middle**.


###### UDL on the Shear Force Diagram

The maximum bending moment is where the line crosses the horizontal 0 axis on the shear force diagram. 


##### Axial Loads
