aliases: Resolving Forces
---
A unresolved force is split into two seperate components, the goal is to combine them into a single force.

- The vertical component is $F_V$ and;
- The horizontal componenent is $F_H$ 

$F_V$ = $Force \times \sin\theta$
$F_H$ = $Force \times cos\theta$

**All forces must be in respect to the horizontal plane**.
## Theta ($\theta$) will be the the same for both

By doing this you seperate the forces into their **components**. You then need to reduce all the components down to one value in the horizontal and vertical directions.

you can do this like so;
![[Excalidraw - Resolution of one angled force into vertical and horizontal force.excalidraw]]
If there are multiple forces you can draw multiple of these,
Then figure out what forces are *dominating*, if there is two horizontal forces in opposite directions, whatever one is higher wins and has it's value subtracted from the smaller one.

Once you have finished, treat this like a triangle, and find the hypotenuse, for the example above you would do the following
$$\sqrt{38.82^2+144.88^2}$$
![[Force Triangle.excalidraw]]
