Converge - to combine together
Digital (Devices) - Technology we use.

Convergence of *many devices* into *one*.

Mobile Phones replace Cameras, Flashlights, microphones G.P.S, e.t.c.

- in the old days, one device did one job eg a telephone only made calls to people a camera only took photos, you needed a GPS to nvigate.
- Mobile phones becoming 'smart', by better processing, memory, screen resolution, has caused the start to convergence
- People want desktop cmputer power in a phone, it is starting to happen.

>[!cite]+ Impacts of Digital Convergance
>#### Neutral Impacts
>- Phone companies (and others) need to branch out, change design, keep up with competitors or go out of business (e.g. nokia)
>  - Fewer devices, if your one Tablet can make calls and all tasks needed then you no longer need 3 or 4 devices (good for environment, and consumer, bad for competition)
>#### Positive Impacts
>- Amazing continual progres in processing, memory annd retenstion
>  - New business providing these technologies
>  - Less Waste to dispose since fewer devices
>#### Negative Impacts
>- Unemployment from companies going out of business
>- Devices are replaced quickly as they become obsolete

>[!danger] Dangers of Digital Convergance
>
>#### Cyber Attacks
>Everything centrallised into one device, means that device being compromised is a danger to everything else. E.g. Iphone Passcode can be used to access bank, Medibank hack, etc.
>
>#### Competition - Vendor Lock-in
>2 Companies control the 2 mobile phone operating systems, switching between them is deliberately painful  and with all information on these devices people are reluctant to switch, thus making it harder for 3rd party companies to compete with the two giants.
