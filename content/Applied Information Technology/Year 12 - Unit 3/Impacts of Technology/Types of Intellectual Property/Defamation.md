- **Of Dematory Content**: The content must *cause damage* to the other persons reputation.
- **To another**; The content must have een communicated to another person.
- **Identifying a Person**; The content must identify a person.
- **Without lawful excuse**, If there was no lawful reason as to why the content was published.

If you are the victim of defamation, you can ask the person to remvoe the content, issue an apology, or fix the problem (i.e. payment, exchange of goods, etc.)
