 
 A corporate business is considering moving all of its files and data to a cloud storage system in the near future. Some employees have concerns about the proposal and are worried that their work will be lost or stolen. Management are keen for this to go ahead and have approached you to write a full report on Cloud Computing to present to the employees of the company.
 
## Part 1: Write a Professional Report on Cloud Computing:
Research and find relevant information about Cloud Computing.
•	Provide a definition of Cloud Computing
•	List and explain 5 benefits (legal, social and environmental) of Cloud Computing using examples to support your discussion.
•	List and explain 5 drawbacks (legal, social and environmental) of Cloud Computing using examples to support your discussion.
•	Write a convincing statement (250 words) to persuade the target audience that they should adopt Cloud Computing.
•	Include references.
 
## Part 2: Create an Animation:
Your report was a great success and you have now been recruited by a Cloud Storage company to help promote their services and raise awareness of Cloud Computing in the corporate world. Your first assignment is to create an animation that will be distributed and used as part of the company's advertising campaign.
•	Complete a storyboard (with annotations) for an animation NO LONGER than 2 minutes in duration.
•	Include an appropriate character to enhance your animation.
•	Include audio to enhance your animation.
•	Utilise design elements/principles to create a professional-looking product that will appeal to the corporate business audience.
•	Submit a reflection of your final animation covering positives, negatives, and ways you could improve.



## Benefits of Cloud Computing

#### Flexibility
- Growing businesses do not have to *scale up* themselves as their business expands, 
- Instantaneous scaling as businesses do not need to manually *install* & maintain their own servers.
- Scaling down is easy, and no selling of servers is needed
#### Disastor Recovery
- Automatic disastor recovery protection (e.g. rollbacks / seperate datacenters in multiple locations)
#### Updates
- Computer maintenance is unnecessary as the cloud computers are always up to date
> Less of an issue today as a result of docker containers which both allow automatic updates of the latest version and pinning certain dependancies to prevent software from breaking due to updates. They are also alot lighter than the VMs used to host cloud servers.

#### Minimise Capital Expenditure
- No need to pay for expensive hardware, also minimises the *risk* of the investment as scaling down can happen immediatly.




#### Collaboration
- The cloud allows teams to cross access, edit, and share documents, anytime, and from anywere.

#### Cloud Workstations
- Powerful computers can be accessed remotely from less powerful machines to do work that only powerful machines are capable of. (e.g. Data analysis / machine learning etc.)

#### Streamlined content
- Allows for there to be one *true source* of a particular docuent, the one stored in the cloud.
- Central Storage in the cloud prevents file conflicts, and version mismatches. Everyone sees updates live and can avoid causing issues.
#### Security
- Only the company managing the particular cloud has to worry about security.
- As long as credentials are stored securely, data can be accessed even with a lost device.
#### SaaS
- Cloud Computing gives access to *enterprise-class* technology that is only accessible to large companies. the cloud allows smaller companies to access this
#### Save time
[51%](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/blog/2015/11/why-move-to-the-cloud-10-benefits-of-cloud-computing.html) of employees say moving to the cloud has helped to save time post-integration.
#### Uptime
Cloud services have excellant uptime since servers that need to be updated can simply have their VMs moved to another server temporarily withotu affecting any of the vms themelves.
