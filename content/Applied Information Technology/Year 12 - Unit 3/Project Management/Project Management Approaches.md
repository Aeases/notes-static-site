There are two approaches to undertake and complete projects;
- [[#Prototype approach]]
- [[#Structured Approach]]




## Prototype approach
- Prototype = a model of a product or solution
- Prototyping = An interactive process to develo pa system or product. users and developers interact.
- Can be used for Larg scale = building a bridge or new skyscraper. Small Scale = completeing a website or a graphic design
- Involes four steps:
	1. Identify basic requirements
	2. Develop initial prototype
	3. User review
	4. Review and enhance the prototype
(Steps *3* and *4* can repeat until the final prototype is agreed upon)

>>##### Pros of **Prototype** Approach
>>- User can see the model and be eable to talk about it
>>- Helps resolve discrepancies among users
>>- Gives users a feel for the final system
>>- helps determine technical feasibility
>>- Helps sell the idea of a proposed system

>>##### Cons of **Prototype** Approach
>>- Leads people to believe the prototype product will be the same as the final product
>>- Gives no indication of performance under operational conditions
>>- Leads the project team to forgo proper testing and documentation

## Structured Approach
Traditional style of project management with stages which include; Initiation, Planning, Production, Monitoring and C losing.

The structured approach has 5 stages;

1. **Initiation**
	- What are the needs?
	- What is in place at the moment?
	- What is the cost?
	- Who will be using it?
	- Who will be developing it?
2. **Planning**
	- Develop the scope (what is involved in the project)
	- Select the planning team
	- Identify tasks and who will do them
	- Estimate resources needed for tasks
	- Estimate time and cost
	- Develop a schedule
	- Develop a budget
3. **Production**
	- Commence the tasks from the Planning Stage.
4. **Monitering**
	- Are we able to continue?
	- Who is behind in their work?
	- How do we fix problems?
	- Is there a problem wit the cost because a task if taking too long, unforseen
	- Costs have come up
5. **Closing**
	- Hardening over the finished product
	- Writing an evaluation of the project
