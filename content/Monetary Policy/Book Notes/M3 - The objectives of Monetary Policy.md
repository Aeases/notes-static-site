The Objectives of Monetary policy are defined by the RBA:
![[Reserve Bank of Australia#RBA Policy Objectives|clean-shadow]]

>[!abstract] The RBA is "broader" than most central banks
>Most Central Banks focus on [[Price Stability]].
>The RBA now focuses on "**Inflation-targeting**" since previous monetary policy approaches did not deliver acceptable price stability & [[Macro-economic Objectives|Macro-economic Outcome]].
>Other countries that have adopted Inflation Targeting include;
>	New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden

#### Why Target Inflation?

![[Inflation#Reasons why inflation is regarded as a risk; (YIRCEAD)|clean no-h]]
Most importantly, by announcing an Inflation Target it influences the expectations of firms and households, this can;
- Help maintain a satisfactory rate of economic growth.
- It also helps maintain [[Full Employment]]
	- because it promotes **Business Confidence** and encourages [[Investment]].
	- 



>[!example]- #econs-example Since setting inflation targets, inflation has fallen in the countries implementing "**Inflation-targeting**". <br><br> In Australia the RBA credits inflation targeting for keeping inflation low, and in promoting a [[Reserve Bank of Australia#RBA Policy Objectives|satisfactory rate of economic growth]].
>Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden ([[Chapter 13 - Monetary Policy.pdf#page=4&selection=22,0,33,3|source]])



Thus, keeping Inflation Low helps the RBA achieve;
- [[Price Stability]]
- [[Reserve Bank of Australia#RBA Policy Objectives|The Maintenance of Full Employment]]
- Which the [[Chapter 13 - Monetary Policy.pdf#page=4&selection=185,0,250,10|RBA believes]] will lead to "**Economic Prosperity**", meaning;
	- Increases in Real GDP Per Capita
	- Long-term [[Economic Growth]]
	- Rising [[Standard Of Living|Living Standards]]


### Different Measures of Inflation:
- The CPI is the "**Headline Rate**" of [[Inflation]] for ***household expenditure***. this can be adjusted to estimate an '***underlying***' or '***core***' inflation rate by;
	- *Removing Goods with Volatile Prices*
		- e.g. Fruit and Vegetable prices that exhibit [[Seasonal Pattern|Seasonal Volatility]].
	- *Removing retail Petrol prices*
		- since these reflect movements in world oil prices, as well as changes in the [[Exchange Rate]].

The RBA also calculates;
- **Weighted Median**
	- Eliminate outlier groups at the top of the CPI.
- **Trimmed Mean**
	- Eliminate outlier groups at the bottom end of the CPI.
The Average of the T.M and W.M can be an estimate of the "***underlying***" rate of inflation.
