Monetary policy is what the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] uses to manipulate [[Aggregate Demand]], [[Unemployment|Employment]], and [[Inflation]] within the Economy.

#### The Main Tool of Monetary Policy
The [[Cash Rate|Interbank Overnight Cash Rate]] is the **main tool of Monetary Policy**. The process it undergos looks like this;
- on the first tuesday of every month, analyse [[#Indicators Taken into Account by the RBA in deciding Monetary Policy|key economic indicators]];
- **if** The [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] decides to alter the **cash rate target**, it will announce it at 12:30, and implement it from the next day.
	- RBA usually only alters the Cash Rate by ~**0.25%** per month.
- RBA then uses [[Open Market Operations]] as necessary to achieve that target in the [[Overnight Money Market|Interbank Market]].
	- The Interbank Market / **overnight money market** consists of [[Approved Deposit-Taking Instituitions]] (ADIs) who create demand for funds in the Interbank Market.
