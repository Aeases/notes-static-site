>[!cite] Cost of Borrowing / Savings & Investment Incentives
>A Channel of the [[Transmission Mechanism]]

>How **Households** and **Businessess** change their decisions on whether to **save**, or **Borrow** (Invest) as a result of changes in; "The cost of borrowing", and the "opportunity cost of spending", both of which are influenced by [[Interest Rate]]s.


#### ðŸ ±Cash Rate (Contrac.)
Households Increase their savings as Interest Rates increase because of;
- The Opportunity Cost of spending is higher, they could instead invest their money in a Interest-earning account and get greater **Interest Receipts** as Interest Rates rise.
- Increased Cost of Borrowing, higher Interest Rates mean you must make greater **Income payments** for the same amount of funds.
>Businesses also borrow to invest, as Interest Rates rise;
- The increased Cost of borrowing means there is a **decrease in demand for business loans**.
	- Because the increased cost means a lower potential return on investment.
#### â¬‡Cash Rate (Expan.) 
Expansionary Monetary Policy is generally less effective in a contraction or trough.
Businesses **do necessarily react** to lower costs of borrowing during periods of low economic confidence in prospects while [[Aggregate Demand]] is low.
	A pertinant example is in recent years with *record low* interest rates of 0.1%, yet Investment was still low.
Lower Interest Rates can encourage **household borrowing**, as they can pay lower repayments
