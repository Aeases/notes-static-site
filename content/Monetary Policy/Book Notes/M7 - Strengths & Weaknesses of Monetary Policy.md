>[!success] pretty much te opposite of the [[L6 - Strengths & Weaknesses of Fiscal Policy|Fiscal Policy Strengths & Weaknessses]]

>[!cite] This is good for evaluating the "***Effectiveness*** of monetary policy"

# Strengths of Monetary Policy
- #### Flexibility
	- The RBA meets every month as opposed to once a year, meaning it has a **very low** [[Time Lags#Decision Lag]]
- #### Neutral Political Stance, politics do not have an effect on it.
- #### More effective during **periods of high aggregate demand & Inflation**.


# Weaknesses of Monetary Policy
#### - **Less effective** during a [[The Business Cycle#Contraction / Downswing|Downturn]]. 
- You can use it to stop people from spending in a boom, however, in a downturn when people do not have much money, a lower interest rate won't help as much.
  This is largely a result of two of the [[Transmission Mechanism#Transmission Mechanism Channels|transmission channels]]
  - The [[Cost of Borrowing]] channel
	  - Businesses don't necessarily react to lower C.o.B when Economic Confidence is low.
	  - [[Chapter 13 - Monetary Policy.pdf#page=6&selection=1504,0,1540,0|Pertinant Example]]
  - The [[Asset Prices]] channel
	- Asset Prices are largely influenced by the expectation of future income that will come from an asset. Low Economic Confidence reduces this.

	Companies aren't prone to borrowing when Economic Confidence is low,
	 decreases (Low [[Interest Rate]]), they don't invest a large amount more.
#### Broad (not targeted like [[L6 - Strengths & Weaknesses of Fiscal Policy#Can ***target*** specific economic sectors.|like fiscal policy can]])
This is largely due to two of the channels in the [[Transmission Mechanism]], that being 

#### **Asset Prices** are influenced by other factors as-well
- Asset prices are influecned by different factors, only partly the **Interest Rate**. for example, the *expected future price of the asset*.
#### Untargeted
Monetary Policy can not be applied to a single sector of the economy. It is a "**one size fit's all policy**"
- The RBA can not exclusively rise rates in a particular industry. e.g. car industry. A rise in the Interest Rate effects the economy as a whole.
- The RBA can not exclusively raise rates in WA, and keep them unchanged in the rest of the country if WA experience a downturn.

## Extremey long **effect lag** (up to 18 monts)
 This is because the [[Transmission Mechanism]] chain from the cash rate to changes in **aggregate demand** is indirect. as opposed to fiscal policy which is direct, imposing direct costs on the transactions themselves.

# Contemporary Limits of Effectiveness
##### Summary of RBA since 2016

There was a 3 year gap between RBA economic activity between **3rd of Augest 2016**, and the **5th of June 2019**, durign his period the InterestRate stayed constant at 0.25%.

Monetary Policy was in an ***expansioanry stance***, since between **5th of June of 2019**, and **4th of November 2020**, the Cash Rate went from 0.25% all the way

## Limiting Expansionary Monetary Policy
