## Monetary Policy Stances

###### Expansionary Monetary Stance
- When there is **upwards movement** in the [[Cash Rate]] over a period of time.
	- Cash Rate is increasing.
###### Contractionary Monetary Stance
- When there is a **downwards movement** in the [[Cash Rate]] over a period of time.
	- Cash Rate is going down.
## Understanding the Neutral Monetary Policy Stance
The Neutral policy stance is when we are at [[#The Neutral Rate]] for the Cash Rate.


###### Real Policy Rate
The Real Policy Rate refers to the [[Cash Rate]] adjusted for inflation. or; $$\text{Current Cash Rate }- \text{Underlying Inflation Rate (Last Quarter)} = \text{Real Policy Rate}$$
#### The Neutral Rate
The Neutral rate is a benchmark that helps us understand the monetary policy stance at any point in time. 
- The Neutral rate is the [[#Real Policy Rate]] that is **Neither Expansionary, or Contractionary**. 
- The RBA reckons that gauging the Neutral Rate is **challenging in practise** since it cannot be directly observed. 
	- 	- (from RBA. Meeting Minutes July 2022)
- The Neutral Rate must instead be ***inferred from Data***. Rather than observation.
	- it is **not possible calculate the rate itself** or observe it.
	- Thus, Neutral Rate estimates must be treated with caution.
	- They are useful for assessing the Monetary Policy stance at any point though.

##### Neutral Rate Trends

###### 1990 - 2007
The RBA estimated a netural rate between **3** and **4** percent.

###### 2008 - 2020
The RBA estimated a steady decline in the neutral, possibly being around **0.5 percent** at the start of 2020 due to the long period of stagnant/slow growth after the GFC

###### 2022
The book reckons the **neutral rate** would've risen somewhat because inflation is rising. (Contractionary Stance).

However, 
- the Real Policy Rate would be negative 
- This is because the Cash Rate is 2.85% and underlying inflation is around 5.5%
- $C.R - U.I.R$ / Cash Rate - Underlying Inflation Rate, comes out to; $$2.85\% - 5.5\%=\boxed{\color{gold}-2.65\%}$$
- A negative Neutral Rate implies a **Expansionary Stance**, however simultaneously interest rates on housing loans rose from ~2.8% in April 2022 to 6.4% in November 2022

## Impact of a Contractionary Stance

![[Figure 13.6 - Contractionary Monetary Policy.excalidraw|100%]]
In the models above we can see the impact of Contractionary [[Monetary Policy]].
- **AE. Model** 
	- A Higher [[Cash Rate]] reduces Aggregate Expenditure.
		- The Equilibrium level of income moves from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- **AD/AS Model**
	- Assuming Economic Activity was beyond it's potential, beyond the [[Long Run Aggregate Supply Curve|LRAS Curve]], at $Y_1$, and price levels at $P_1$
	- Contractionary Stance shifts AD curve to the left ($AD_1$ to $AD_2$)
		- This reduces **both** the **rate of [[Economic Growth|Growth]]**, and the rate of increases in prices ([[Inflation]])






# Recent Trends in the Cash Rate (Monetary Policy)
From this part of the book; [[Chapter 13 - Monetary Policy.pdf#page=4&selection=923,0,1023,1|Chapter 13 - Monetary Policy, page 4]]


Between 2015 and 2020;
- The RBA cut the cash rate several times reaching just **0.10%**.
- It stood at 0.10% for a **Year and a Half**, this being the *lowest Cash Rate in Australian History.*
	- Around this period some countries even had a negative cash rate (japan)
- Rates rose rapidly after **May 2022**, in response to rising inflation.

>[!note] Weakness Indicated between 2015 and 2020
>The [[Cash Rate]] Target fell between the years 2015 and 2020 from **2.25%** to **0.1%**, indicating weakness in the economy following the mining boom, and then the offset of the COVID Pandemic.
>In 2022 it rose to counter inflationary pressure.
