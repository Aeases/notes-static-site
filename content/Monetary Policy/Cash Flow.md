>[!cite] Cash Flow
>Cash Flow is a Channel in the [[Transmission Mechanism]] referring to how changes in **interest rates** affect the **Disposible Cash** / **Liquidity** of both Households / Firms, when it flows through the economy it affects [[Aggregate Demand]] through [[Aggregate Expenditure#Consumption (**C**) 55-60%|Cosnumption]] and [[Aggregate Expenditure#Investments (**I**) - 16-23%|Investment]].

#### How Interest Rates affect Cash Flow

When Interest Rate rise;
- The Interest Payments for borrowers rise
	- Thus they can't spend elsewhere.
- Savers Interest Receipts rise
	- Meaning they receive more cash for other spending

These **work in opposite directions**, generally though Lower Interest Rates result in ***greater spending in the economy***.
The Majority of Businesses are Borrowers, some households are borrowers, others are savers.
