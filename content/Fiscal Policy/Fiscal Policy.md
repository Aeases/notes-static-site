Money coming in is greater than money going out
- More likely to occur in a [[The Business Cycle#Expansion / Upswing|Upswing]].
##### Deficit Budget
When the money going out is higher than the money coming in.
- More likely in a [[The Business Cycle#Contraction / Downswing|Trough / Downswing]].

### Difference between planned & Actual Budget Outcome
Since circumstances change in the time between

##### Planned budget outcome
The prediced difference between government earnign and government expenditure announced by the Treasuer in may.
- E.g. in 2022-23 it was **planned to be** a  deficit of $78b
##### Actual Budget Outcome
The actual budget outcome refers to the actual difference between the revenue earnt by government and government expenditure.
- **e.g.** In 2022-23 the actual **budget** outcome is expected to be a small surplus of $4b.

>[!example] Why we went from deficit to surplus in 2022-23 #econs-example 
>The cash deficit for 2022-23 was much samller than expected as a result of low unemployment, which boosted income tax, and lowers social security expenses. Strong Commodity prices boosted tax revenue from mining companies as well, pushing us from our 134.2 billion 2020/21 to 32.0 billion in 2021/22.

| Factor           | Predicted (2022-23) | Actual (2022-23) |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Real GDP         | 3.5                 | 3.25             |
| Unemployment     | 3.75                | 3.5              |
| CPI3             | 3                   | 6                 |
| Wage Price Index | 3.25                | 3.75                 |


>Wages increased faster than they thought, and inflation increased much faster than expected as shown by the CPI being 6 rather than 3. Unemployment was also lower, and real GDP also growed to a lesser amount then expected.
Lower Unemployment points to more demand-side inflation
Higher wages points to a push to the right on the Aggregate Demand Curve
Real GDP ? not sure check powerpoint #review 

### Fiscal Policy Stances
See [[L4 - Stabilising the Econonomy]]

>[!abstract]- Changes in budget 
>The Budget is often seen as inflexible, it must pass through parliment, be debated etc. 
>>Budget delivered in may by the treasure. it passes through *the senate* by tradition.
>>>December or January gives the option to revisise the budget estimates.

The budget estimate is that we are goign to be indeficit by 13.9B, or if we were to pay it back, 0.5% Of GDP.
