> [!abstract] General Trend
> - As Economic Growth ðŸ“‰ **slows**;
> 	- Budget Outcome quickly turns to Deficit.
> - As Economic Growth ðŸ“ˆ **recovers**;
> 	- Budget Outcome gradually moves *towards* a surplus.
>######  Why does this occur? ([[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=7&selection=1386,0,1453,8|source]])
> This occurs due to [[L4 - Stabilising the Econonomy#Automatic Stabilisers|Automatic Stabilisers]] as well as the Discretionary adjustments that follow them in either the positive or negative direction.
>  
>  Gradual movement *towards* a surplus is primarily a result of Automatic Stabilisers (ðŸ ±tax revenue/â¬‡Welfare). 
>  *generally*, we are still in a Expansionary Stance during the Recovery phase even though we get closer to a surplus because [[L5 - Budget Stance & Balance#The Balance & The Stance|the stance is determined by the structural balance]].

>>[!example] #econs-example 
>> Post-GFC Structural Measures were being put in place, even all the way up to 2017 yet we kept approaching a surplus due to Automatic Stabilisers. ([[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=8&selection=83,2,142,6|source]])

## 2008 - 2009
 [[Global Financial Crisis#What Happened?|After the GFC]] everyone attempted to limit their exposure to Mortgages / Morgage Backed Securities to avoid risk.

##### Outcome of these Policy Adjustments ([[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=8&selection=538,0,593,10|source]])
Within 2008-2009 Australia managed to avoid recession, in 2008-2009;
- Economic Growth was just **1.8%**
- Unemployment was nearly **6%**.
	- Fears of it rising above 10%

 And This was despite Australia having a;
 - Favourable Terms of Trade
- Strong demand for Minerals
Thanks to those, we were able to survive the GFC better than any other western country.

# Post-GFC
- Australia averaged only **2.5%** growth per annum from 2010-19
	- Largest growth between 2010-19 was *2011-12* with 3.9%
- Average Rate of "High Income" countries was only **2%** from 2010-19.
- Government Debt hit 10% in 2013 ([source](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/government-debt-to-gdp))

>- Reduced Unemployment entitlements for people under 25
>- "Temporary budget repair" Tax on high Income Earners.
>  
>  All Measures abandoned by Early 2015 due to their ability to be elctorally damaging.

Econ. Growth and Wage increases did not help to improve household budgets.

>It became apparent to the government that they *could not use the budget to prematurely exit a deficit*.

## Fiscal Policy Outlook 2023-25

- Australian Budget is forecast to **stay in deficit** for the next decade.
	- Usually budgets return to surplus after *5-6* Years. It has been *14*.

##### What has prevented the "balancing" of the budget
- COVID led to much larger stimulus than what was applied during the GFC in 2008. 
- Russian Invasion of Ukraine causing Disruption in Feb. 2022
	- Impacted Energy & Food Supply world-wide
- Severe Flood events in the eastern states.

Those listed above are **supply-side** problems.

Policy Responses however have focused on the demand side instead, likely due to;
- Lack of Real Wage increases
- Household budgets eing stretched by rising Electricity, gas, and food costs.
- Rising Rent and mortgage prices
	- e.g. a 25 Year, $500,000 loan has increased by $650
