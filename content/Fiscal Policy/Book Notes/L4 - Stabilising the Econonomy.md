Government Economic Policy is meant to **smooth the actions of the business cycle**. Aka. it is referred to as *countercyclial*, it counters the cycle.

### Differentiate Automatic Stabilisers & Discretionary Fiscal Policy
Automatic Stabilisers are not drived by deliberate government action, but instead by policies that have already been enacted into law, things like centrelink resulting in **Transfer Payments**. Or increased Tax Revenue as a natural result of a more active economy.

[[#Discretionary Fiscal Policy]] is the opposite, it is things like **Jobseeker** that the government deliberately puts in palce to deal with problems.  

### Similarities between Auto Stabilisers & Discretionary Fiscal Policy
Both Stabilisers & Disc. Fiscal Policy smooth out the business cycle, pulling it closer to the trend line, they compliment one another, amplifying the effect of their complementary.
# Automatic Stabilisers
Automatic stabilisers refer to how government revenue and expenditure change as a result of changes in the busienss cycle. **These are beyond the control of government**.
	There is legislation that prevents the government changing some things here, atleast in the short-term.
#### Concept
![[AutomaticStabalisersDiagram.excalidraw]]

 Automatic Stabiliser graph contains two lines

- The Tax Revenue Line
	- The **Tax Revenue** line is positvely sloped, this is because as economic activity rises, the government makes more revenue.
- The **Transfer Payments** line (eg. Welfare)
	- Whereas; the **Transfer Payments** line is negatively sloped, since claims on welfare fall as economic activity rises. 

>[!example] Example Scenarios
>
>##### Slowing Economy
Starting from the budget balance point, if the economy slows, then tax revenue will slow, and Transfer payments will rise, **automatically** pushing us a **budget deficit**
>
>##### Expanding Economy
>Starting from the budget balance point, and the economy expands, tax revenue will increase, and transfer payments fall, **automatically**, pushing the budget towards surplus

#### Impact of Automatic Stabilisers
- Automatic stabilisers cause the budget to **vary over the course of the business cycle**. They affect / are the [[Federal Budget#Structural Component|Structural Component]] of the Budget.
- Income taxes & transfer payments act like an economic shock absorber
	- In a economic boom, **Income Tax** rise, and **Welfare/Transfer payments** fall, *preventing them from rising too much*. In this way itacts like an economic shock absorber.
	- In a economic bust, **Income Tax** is low, and **Welfare/Transfer payments** are high, pushing up economic activity in a time where it isusually falling.
- Simply; Income taxes and trasnfer payments act as a economic shock absorber in that; they increase the economy in a downturn, and decrease it in a upturn.

- ***Automatic Stabilisers do not completely mitigate peaks and troughs, only dampen them.***.

# Discretionary Fiscal Policy
- Discretionary Fiscal Policy is "**deliberate** changes to the [[Federal Budget|The Budget]] that the government makes  to **stabilise** the economy."

##### Examples of Discretionary Policy - [[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=4&selection=11,4,15,8|Source]]
- Reducing income tax to increase household purchasing power;
- Cutting corporate tax to stimulate **businesses** to spend on inputs, employment, and investment
- Increasing government spending on Infrastructure
	- e.g. Transport & Communications projects
- Direct payments to households and/or firms


## Expansionary Policy Stance
A Expansionary stance is useful to help stimulate spending. 
It is usually assosciated with a [[L2 - Budget Outcomes#The Budget Outcome|Budget Deficit]], meaning, Planned Expenditure is higher than revenue.

### Using the Keynesian Models to Analyse Fiscal Policy

#### Expans. Stance - [[Aggregate Expenditure Model]]
![[Pasted image 20230821000705.png]]
>**Can also show this using the ADAS model**
- Economic Growth Increases
- Low levels of Cyclical Unemployment
- Moving up to 4%
#### Expans. Stance - [[Aggregate Demand & Supply ]] Model


The government takes an **expansioanry policy stance**, taking on a budget deficit using some of the [[#Examples of Discretionary Policy - Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf page=4&selection=11,4,15,8 Source|Discretionary Methods of Fiscal Policy]], this causes the AE line to increase up to the level of Full employment, closing the gap.
The effect of their rise in [[Aggregate Expenditure#G2 - Capital Spending - **discretionary**|Discretionary G2 Spending]] ($25b) induces the multiplier effect, causing a **greater than proportional** rise ($50b) in AE to close the gap.
> #ask_davis why does this cause multiplier, isn't discretionary g2 spending not autonomous?
