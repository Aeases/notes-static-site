# Strengths of Fiscal Policy
- **Fiscal Policy is direct**.
	- Changes can be made very quickly if they need to be.
	- #econs-example E.g. the treasurer announces a increase in the *excise tax rate* on a commodity immediatly aftter the budget.
	- #econs-example A Reduction in marginal rates of taxation after a arbitrary date.

---
- *Consumers immediatly feel the impact* of Fiscal Policy changes.
	- Government can pass a law and immediatly influence consumers in the short-term
- Can target **specific economic sectors**.
- Can Affect [[Aggregate Supply]]
	- e.g. Stimulus on Infrastructure Projects

---
Fiscal Policy helps the economy **during a recession**.  Government can open a "**spending tap**", artificially increasing the level of aggregate demand.
- #econs-example In the 1930s government funds helped to build *infrastructure*, thus *employing workers*. Providing immediate boost to **employment**, **spending power**, and **consumption**.
- #econs-example During the GFC, governments provided stimulus packages to avoid recession.
- #econs-example COVID-19 saw governments providing stimulus to avoid recession
Well timed fiscal policy measures combined with [[L4 - Stabilising the Econonomy#Automatic Stabilisers|Automatic Stabilisers]] help to dam-=pen booms, and in a downturn help to stimulate economic activity
# Weaknesses of Fiscal Policy

#### Time Lag / Decision Lag
- **Decision Lag** is the lag between Economic Indicator and the Fiscal Response
#### Inflexible
It is difficult to deviate from previous budget trends. 

- Treasury cannot make large changes to [[L1 - Government Revenue and Expenditure#Allocations / Allocative Function|Allocative]], or [[L1 - Government Revenue and Expenditure#Redistributive Function|Redistributive]] patterns.
**Social**, **Demographic**, and **political** constraints determine the "Fabric of the budget" (the [[Federal Budget#Components of the Budget|Composition of the Budget]])
For example;
- We Cannot cut all defence spending to fix the economy
- Government cannot cut all social security pyments
- Government cannot massively increase social security benefits
	- Funding larger benefits would be hugely *expensive* / could *discourage labour* 
- Government cannot increase and decrease tax willy nilly as it could impact future *Consumer* & *Business* confidence.
###### Costs of Compliance
The Government must consider the **costs of compliance** in policy decisions, otherwise changes could put undue presure on businesses.
#### Political Constraints
Since governments seek re-election, when approaching an election;
- Governments may bias towards [[L1 - Government Revenue and Expenditure|Expansioanry Budget]].
	- In an attempt to "buy" votes preceding an election
	- #econs-example In May 2022, The Teasurer delivered an expansionary budge t prior to an election in october, the new government announced a budget that limited expenditure growth in order to bring down the deficit. 
	  Data used to compile [[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=2&selection=511,0,514,0|Figure 12.1]] and [[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=7&selection=1499,0,1502,1|Figure 12.7]] refer to that budget.

#### Crowding out
Refers to the hypothesis that, during a **deficit**, the *Private Sector* can not help in the recoverty since the "cost of borrowing" is higher (High [[Interest Rate]]), as well as the tightening of the supply of loanable funds. 
Thus; Firms can't help i nthe recovery because
- The availability of loanable money falls 
- The Price of loanable money rises
- The **risk** of borrowing increases
	- This is also refered to as a change in the "opportunity cost" of borrowing, where Capital Investment is not as profitable in comparison to risk.
---
- Risk of crowding out becoming a "**Zero-sum game**"
	- Increased Government Expenditure >
	- Decreased Private Sector Activity
	- **Causing no-effect on the economy**
#### Conflicting Policy Approaches


#### Less effective during boom
