# The First Massacure

---

The Fanatic: 
"Does anybody want to speak to me here?"
"Does anybody want to talk."
"HOW YOU, CAME TO BE, IN POSSESSION? IN POSSESSION? OF POLICE UNIFORM?"
"THIS, THIS UNIFORM"





# Post-First Massacure
Large amount of silence.
"WEll spoken"
"Great to finally have a comrade who speaks english"
"These are your best friends out here, and you must use them to"
"Sic Transit gloria mundi"
"So passes the glorious world" < [[#Hanging Scene Transcript|same thing the tracker says to fanatic]]
"Their cannibals very treaturous! you have to be firm with 'em they'll kill a white man in broad daylight"
"kid, the government employs me for a certain duty, they supply me with men, rifles, revolvers and ammunition in abundance, and they expect me to use them, for the betterment of the country".





"you shouldn't have killed those natives" < *the veteran*


"No such thing as an innoocent black, the only innnocent black is a dead black" - The (black) tracker

*the significance of the painting*;
Scenes of violence on aboriginal people are not shown, but instead represented through a painting. This impacts the audience as we are presented with [[Extradiagetic Audio]] (maybe) of the scene taking place, with a visual representation that does not move, allowing us to contemplate it.

I'm pretty sure "The Leader" / "The Fanatic" (the old dude) doesnt get a painting to represent his death, likely due to him not being aboriginal.

- "He understands what you cant, because he's a white man"

The follower segregates himself from the rest of the group, at the campfire, he appears as if he is in his own world. He wanders out into the bush in the middle of the night, he says "Hello", *the tracker* disapperared, he tells *the fanatic*, who hits him, and immediatly assuems he will come back with mroe to kill them.
## Tracker in Chains
"The black tracker he just disappeared"
Fanatic smacks Follower
"What are we gonna do now?" - The Follower
"Don't worry he'll be back, just dont know with how many others..." - the fanatic
"Hey white-fella bush tucka boss" - The Tracker
"I don't know what your up to, but your not doing it again" - The Fanatic
"Fasten him to a tree." - The fanatic

"I'm Sorry" - The Veteran #contrition
"Sorry? wanna feel sorry for someone feel sorry for the pack-horse, now theres an innocent victim. " - The Fanatic
"but this one, don't waste your sentiment on him, he wouldn't appreciate it" #contrition - The Fanatic


*The fanatic* chains up the tracker to a tree when he comes back with bush tucka which the tracker only did to help them.
The Veteran feels sorry for the tracker when he chains him up.

> "We can no longer roam lands, we are all chained" (not sure what happened after that)

---
"We are no longer free"
"We live bound by chains"
"No more our lands wandering"
"Is this where we're going to?"
"People who... in chains"
<hr>

"Chained like a dog" - Music
"now i see them" - Tracker
"Worse then a dog" - Music
"plenty trouble coming boss" - Tracker
"whats that mean" - Fanatic
"that mean plenty trouble coming" - Tracker
"musical aboriginal language"

## [The Follower questions the tracker ](https://clickv.ie/w/n7Pv)
Fanatic: "Whats your problem"

Follower: 
"You don't honestly believe him do you?"
"Anyone can see he's not really tracking",
"He's just following hisn ose and hoping for the best"

Fanatic: Is that right?
*follower nods in reply*.
Fanatic: \*Speaks in aboriginal language\*
Tracker: \*Replies in aboriginal language\*
Fanatic: "He'll show you"
Fanatic: "Well geto ff your horse he's not gonna climb up with you"
*Cuts to veteran close-up, then back again*

Tracker: "There, boss"
*Cuts to fanatic watching them, then cuts back again*
Follower: There where? I don't see anything
Tracker: "That stone been missing"
Follower: *mockingly* "There's millions of stones"
Tracker: 
"There, that stone belong there, boss"
"It's been kicked away about two hours ago"
"Nearly dry now."

Follower: "Is that all you need?"
Tracker: "It's enough, Plenty sign like this"
*medium close-up of tracker & fanatic both looking towards the camera, Follower with a shocked expression, and the tracker looking calm / knowledgeable*
Follower: "Sorry."

---


*the veteran* is hit by a spear and cant call out to them, they continue on without realising he's gone.

In the image the tracker is not in chains it doesnt look like, 

"how can we be ever be free"
"if we let the white man be"
"its a contradiction"
"its a contradiction, if your black man"
"its a contradiction"
"its a contradiction, if your white man"

"Don't you have to look after your men" - *the follower* (the tracker smiles at this)
"you can't sentence a man to certain death to capture a black fella" - *the folower*
*the fanatic* threatens him with a gun if he does not come


"Cant believe here life matters none"
"I'd like to be"
"far away home"

The tracker hsa stopped moving to allow *the veteran* to catch up, *the fanatic* whips and shoots in his direction, but *the follower* interjects and says he wont move, and then goes to get *the follower*, this shows the transition of power from *the fanatic* to the *the tracker* since he is the one they need to find the person their searching for.

*the fanatic* kills *the veteran* in his sleep  (he was dying due to spear) though he kills him just so they can't make them ensure he keeps up. (since the tracker threatened to stop tracking if they left him behind)

picture shows the veteran killing him with a hot stick, the tracker sees this occur.

## The drowning Scene

*the tarcker* pulls *the fanatic* into the water, by the chain that *the fanatic* had around his hand, and was attached to the *trackers* neck.
*the tracker* tries to push him under to kill him. but they both get out of the water. 


"no hard feeling boss" - the tracker
in response to being threatened to be shot by *the fanatic* with a gun. 

---
# The Second Massacure
- They stroll up to another aboriginal camp, completely unprovoked *the fanatic* starts shooting.
![[5. Fanatic shoots innocents.png]] ^fcbdb7
- *The follower* points his gun at the head of *the fanatic*, "Drop the gun"
- "They are innocent women and children, drop the gun"
- "DROP THE GUN"
- "get off your house"
- "go over there"
- "MOVE"
*the follower* is extremely shaky, but he now has the most power, being the only one on the horse.

**represents the old *ideology* that ruled the world prior being overthrown by original**

"*I'll have you for this*" - *The fanatic*
"*I'm your superior officer*" - *The fanatic*


"*This is mutiny*" - *The fanatic*

Follower says some more stuff to him, reference back, but he appears much more confident after this, **and** took off his jacket so he appears like the leader did / does.

---
*The tracker* goes over to an elder. *the tracker* begins to cries / quietly sobs over a body, he pulls *the fanatic* off the horse, and holds him there, and shows him what he has done.
	- *the fanatic* just says "*they'll give me a medal for it*"

---
# The Hanging
Later on the tracker gets "White fella bush tucka boss!",
there is someone else there while he gathers food, he "poisons" *the follower*'s food, keeping him unconcious while *the tracker* kills *the fanatic* in the dead of night.

## Leadup to the Hanging
*the tracker* acts as a "Judge and Jury", 

*Sic transit gloria mundi* = **So passes the glorious world**
*Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis* = I absolve you from your sins

The following scene has a song, and the sun ising behind *the fanatic*'s corpse, the white man's shadow is projected into the area around him, the shadows are black, and there are multiple of them, representign the aboriginals that he killed **& hanged** at the beginning of the movie.

 #### Hanging Scene Transcript
- The Tracker: 
	"You are charged with the mruder of innocent people."

	"Who the hell are you?"
The Tracker:

	"I'm your judge and jury"
The Fanatic:
	"Wake up! Wake Up!"
	The Tracker: 


>(Symbolism to how Fanatic knows that the australian courts will find the aboriginals guilty automatically)

"I find you guilty as charged"
"By your actions, you've forgeited the right to live"
"Among your fellow humans"
"I sentence you to hang by the neck until dead."
Fanatic: "You can't do that!"

>How does this show justice and morality


This meta-info provides key ideas, issues, and perspectives present in the film "The Tracker." Some of the key ideas include the acknowledgement of past injustices, the impact of colonization on Indigenous Australians, the complexity of human relationships, and the prevalence of institutionalized racism. The key issue explored is humanity's disregard for human life and the consequences of a brutal past. The privileged perspective presented is the post-colonial perspective, which focuses on Indigenous culture and the impact of government policies. The characters include the Tracker, the Follower, the Veteran, and the Fanatic. The plot revolves around the Tracker leading a group to capture a fugitive, but it delves deeper into the history and effects of colonialism. The drowning scene, the hanging scene, and the second massacre are significant moments in the film. The use of symbolism, such as paintings and Latin phrases, adds depth and meaning to the narrative. The film raises questions about justice and morality in the context of Australia's history.

# Post-hanging

*The tracker* takes over control, he says they 'shouldn't stir up the black fellas anymore" when the follower suggests they take him down and bury him.

"we gotta go after the black fella boss...... now." - *the tracker*

"too many blackfellas around ere boss we betta keeep goin" - the tracker in response the the followers plead to stop and take a rest.

A bunch of aboriginals surround them.
"you do what i tell you to do, and yo udont do anythign i dont tell you to do, that way you survive"



1:26 - The tracker kills the blackfella they were chasing, because he *raped a white women*.

This is symbolic of how the tracker didn't trust *the follower* to kill one of his own (*the fanatic*), where as *the tracker* is willing to stab the blackfella the ytracked, who is also aboriginal for what he did.

>consider that *at the time*, if anyone is killed, they usually just assume it was a aboriginal person.

### The Justice

"He says he not kill a white women boss."
"Him far away, when she killed."

"We should take him in.., we *have* to take him in, he can tell that to the court" - the Follower
"Court already find him guilty boss. Blackfella"
^1922-Australia-Injustice
"He's telling the truth anyway" - *the tracker*
...

---
***the tracker strikes "the fugitive" with a spear***

*gasp* "Why?, why'd you do that? you said he was innocent" - *the Follower*
"Tribal Justice boss, broken the law, aboriginal law"
"Back at the waterhole, with the women, he rape her. she's the wrong skin for him."
"but your a christian, I heard you give absolution"
"god respect aboriginal law as much as he respect white fellas law"
"maybe more"
"now if you wanna stay alive, you better be quiet, and follow me"

![[Fanatic Missing Body.png]]

.... later

- "my land is far away boss, but always I can find it"
- "I wonder who did kill that women?"
- "Prob'ly a white fella boss, they are a murderous, shify, thieving.. dishonest mob! cant trust 'em one bit! <laughing\>"
-
