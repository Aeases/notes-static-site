*song*
"some can't be faulted for theirreasons, failing to justly invervene, some men hide from the memories that haunt, all men choose hte path they walk" < *the veteran*
"some men see everything through duy, cast off responsibility some regret that their courage sometimes fails, all men choose the path they walk" < *the follower*
"some men have attitude thats righteous, care not about the consequence, Some men fight with the violence inside, all men choose the path they walk" < *the fanatic* **(the leader)**
"Some men have reached their destination, finding theor own serenity, some men lead others till they recognise, that all men choose the path they walk." < *the tracker*
"All men choose the path they walk"

"you shouldn't have killed those natives" < *the veteran*


"No such thing as an innoocent black, the only innnocent black is a dead black" - The (black) tracker

*the significance of the painting*;
Scenes of violence on aboriginal people are not shown, but instead represented through a painting. This impacts the audience as we are presented with [[Extradiagetic Audio]] (maybe) of the scene taking place, with a visual representation that does not move, allowing us to contemplate it.

I'm pretty sure "The Leader" / "The Fanatic" (the old dude) doesnt get a painting to represent his death, likely due to him not being aboriginal.

- "He understands what you cant, because he's a white man"

The follower segregates himself from the rest of the group, at the campfire, he appears as if he is in his own world. He wanders out into the bush in the middle of the night, he says "Hello", *the tracker* disapperared, he tells *the fanatic*, who hits him, and immediatly assuems he will come back with mroe to kill them.

*The fanatic* chains up the tracker to a tree when he comes back with bush tucka which the tracker only did to help them.
The Veteran feels sorry for the tracker when he chains him up.

> "We can no longer roam lands, we are all chained" (not sure what happened after that)

"Chained like a dog" - Music
"now i see them" - Tracker
"Worse then a dog" - Music
"plenty trouble coming boss" - Tracker
"whats that mean" - Fanatic
"that mean plenty trouble coming" - Tracker
"musical aboriginal language"

"Anyone can see he's not really tracking, he's just following his nose and hoping for the best" - *the follower* 
"That stone been kicked away about 2 hours ago" - *the tracker*
"Sorry." - *the follower*

The follower feels sorry for the tracker 

*the veteran* is hit by a spear and cant call out to them, they continue on without realising he's gone.

In the image the tracker is not in chains it doesnt look like, 

"how can we be ever be free"
"if we let the white man be"
"its a contradiction"
"its a contradiction, if your black man"
"its a contradiction"
"its a contradiction, if your white man"

"Don't you have to look after your men" - *the follower* (the tracker smiles at this)
"you can't sentence a man to certain death to capture a black fella" - *the folower*
*the fanatic* threatens him with a gun if he does not come


"Cant believe here life matters none"
"I'd like to be"
"far away home"

The tracker hsa stopped moving to allow *the veteran* to catch up, *the fanatic* whips and shoots in his direction, but *the follower* interjects and says he wont move, and then goes to get *the follower*, this shows the transition of power from *the fanatic* to the *the tracker* since he is the one they need to find the person their searching for.

*the fanatic* kills *the veteran* in his sleep  (he was dying due to spear) though he kills him just so they can't make them ensure he keeps up. (since the tracker threatened to stop tracking if they left him behind)

picture shows the veteran killing him with a hot stick, the tracker sees this occur.

*the tarcker* pulls *the fanatic* into the water, by the chain that *the fanatic* had around his hand, and was attached to the *trackers* neck.
*the tracker* tries to push him under to kill him. but they both get out of the water. 


"no hard feeling boss" - the tracker
in response to being threatened to be shot by *the fanatic* with a gun. 

---
- They stroll up to another aboriginal camp, completely unprovoked *the fanatic* starts shooting.
![[5. Fanatic shoots innocents.png]] ^fcbdb7
- *The follower* points his gun at the head of *the fanatic*, "Drop the gun"
- "They are innocent women and children, drop the gun"
- "DROP THE GUN"
- "get off your house"
- "go over there"
- "MOVE"
*the follower* is extremely shaky, but he now has the most power, being the only one on the horse.

**represents the old *ideology* that ruled the world prior being overthrown by original**

"*I'll have you for this*" - *The fanatic*
"*I'm your superior officer*" - *The fanatic*


"*This is mutiny*" - *The fanatic*

Follower says some more stuff to him, reference back, but he appears much more confident after this, **and** took off his jacket so he appears like the leader did / does.

#### The Drowning Scene

*The tracker* goes over to an elder. *the tracker* begins to cries / quietly sobs over a body, he pulls *the fanatic* off the horse, and holds him there, and shows him what he has done.
	- *the fanatic* just says "*they'll give me a medal for it*"




---

Later on the tracker gets  bush tucka,
there is someone else there while he gathers food, they gather some sort of food, he "poisons" the police officers food, keeps him unconcious while *the tracker* kills *the fanatic* in the middle of the night.

#### Leadup to the Hanging

*the tracker* acts as a "Judge and Jury", 

*Sic transit gloria mundi* = **So passes the glorious world**
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis = I absolve you from your sins

The following scene has a song, and the sun ising behind *the fanatic*'s corpse, the white man's shadow is projected into the area around him, the shadows are black, and there are multiple of them, representign the aboriginals that he killed **& hanged** at the beginning of the movie.

---
*The tracker* takes over control, he says they 'shouldn't stir up the black fellas anymore" when the follower suggests they take him down and bury him.

"we gotta go after the black fella boss...... now." - *the tracker*

"too many blackfellas around ere boss we betta keeep goin" - the tracker in response the the followers plead to stop and take a rest.

A bunch of aboriginals surround them.
"you do what i tell you to do, and yo udont do anythign i dont tell you to do, that way you survive"


1:26 - The tracker kills the blackfella they were chasing, because he *raped a white women*.

This is symbolic of how the tracker didn't trust *the follower* to kill one of his own (*the fanatic*), where as *the tracker* is willing to stab the blackfella the ytracked, who is also aboriginal for what he did.

>consider that *at the time*, if anyone is killed, they usually just assume it was a aboriginal person.
