Damon had never made a film before, he grew in confidence in his acting skills as his character grew in confidence throughout the plot of the movie.

When *the fanatic* was hanged, the shot resembles the **aboriginal flag**. They had to shoot the shot 3 times as the sun does nto rise directly upwards.
