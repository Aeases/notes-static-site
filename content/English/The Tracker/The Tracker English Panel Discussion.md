##### The Hanging Scene

The hanging scene strongly depicts  the theme of Justice & Morality;

- Justice & Morality is a powerful theme within The Tracker, throughout the film we see the traditional colonialist british traditions of delivering justice, which are displayed through the two massacures, when we see the fanatic taking on the role of a 

###### Justice & Morality Juxtapose Aboriginal / British Justice

- we see colonial australian justice from point of view of the tracker / aboriginality

The paintings are often a Transition point between what I view as the central themes of *justice & morality*, these themes are centarl to the pursuit of the given authorial context of *The Tracker* being a 2002 Revisionist Western, right in the midst of the history wars, a time where Australia's own prime minister spoke out against Aboriginal Reconcilliation, and denied an Official Apology, it makes sense for Rolf De Heer to attempt to envoke ***empathy***, ***guilt***, and ***remorse*** in the contemporary audience through the exploration of Australia's horrific colonial **injustices**, and the **morality** of the characters who involved.
A prominent example of this is in [[Tracker Analysis#The First Massacure|the First Massacure]], where *the follower*'s morals are subdued as an authority figure, *the fanatic*, encourages him to join in the unjust mocking / Interrogation of innocent aboriginals, who can't speak english, over their posession of a police coat. Throughout the scene the music builds as *The Fanatic* escalates them both from vocals to guns, until *the fanatic* eventually fires his weapon, and *the follower* follows suit. 
**Injustice** is followed by **morality**, The audience is shown the morality of each of the characters through their archetypal reactions to the Massacure, closely parallellign their descriptions at the beginning. we see *the follower* from a slight high-shot on the ground, defeated as his courage has failed,  he could not cast off responsibility for what he has done, *the tracker* pacing in circles, *the veteran*, from eye level, having failed to intervene, who later expresses regret for *the fanatic*'s actions and *the fanatic* from a is depicted from a low shot to emphasise his authority & power, is polishing his gun, "Caring not about the consequence" of the murders he just commited.  

>explain effects of event on each of the characters, showing their morality. except for the fnaatic he "Care not about the consequence", and is hung.
>Metion how both follower / veteran show regret for their actions.




>Rolf De Heer's The Tracker expresses the twin themes of *justice & Morality* through the film's presentation of Morally Just, exerted most prominantly by *the fanatic* in the [[Tracker Analysis#The First Massacure|the First]] & [[Tracker Analysis#The Second Massacure|Second Massacure]], and re-enacted by *the Tracker* in [[Tracker Analysis#The Hanging|the Hanging]]. These are reconciled with themes of the morality 

Linking from `Tyson - Nature and Landscape - Pebble Scene`
	 	 The Inexperience of the follower is used to highlight the tracker's skills

The follower questions the tracker's skills referring to him as "only following his nose" following through on a motif from Archie Roaches lyrics prior to this where aboriginals are compared to dogs e.g. "Chained like a dog", and "Worse than a dog", this is transformed into the follower's acceptance of *the tracker*'s genuine skills & ability unparallelled to any white of the time, allowing him to move beyond the moral facade that aboriginals are only savages, that need to be "put in line" as is stated by *the fanatic*, and fostered by *Colonial Australia*  as whole as indicated by *the fanatic*'s claims that he'll be "given a medal for this", "this" referring to *the fanatic*'s **unjust** murder of an aboriginal elder in [[Tracker Analysis#The Second Massacure|the second massacure]] whom *the tracker* mourns, and the fact that he would be given a medal implies that the Australian government not only provided him with the means to hunt for the fugitive with lethal forces who only allegedly murdered a white women, but would reward him for further murder of the aboriginal population. This signals to the contemporary audience the role of the Australian Government in the injustices we see on screen, especially pertinent to the context of the films release in 2002 as John Howard, Australia's PM spoke out against a official apology the aboriginal people.

Rolf De Heer's further's this in [[Tracker Analysis#The Hanging|the leadup to the fanatic's hanging]] were *the tracker* conducts a **british-style** mock trial using terminology associated with [[Tracker Analysis#^tracker-speaks-latin|british faith]] and [[Tracker Analysis#^tracker-judicial-terminology|the british legal system]], like "Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis", meaning "I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit", with the scene concluding with a harrowing image of the fanatic hung in front of a sun-rise. Unlike the rest of the film, this scene does not hide violence behind a painting. Rolf De Heer deliberately depicts the brutality to emphasise how the british misrepresent Justice, which it then shortly after contrasts with the, supposedly "savage" aboriginal's justice traditions,  that we see shortly after in the films final segment, in which we see a depiction via painting of the Tracker striking the fugitive with a spear, The Follower questions the validity of the Tracker's Christian / British values, saying "Don't you offer absolution". This envokess themes of **Justice & Morality** as we compare the murders & brutality of the British Legal System who at the time hanged those who had done wrong, like *the tracker* did to *the fanatic* as an act of "*justice*", comparatively just aboriginal reparations paid by *the fugitive* in the form of a spear to the leg.








###### Morality Link 1
- On all sides we see people skeptical of the mistreatment of the aborigianl people.
	- The Veteran, despite being apart of the older generation like the fanatic, condemns "the killing of the natives" in the first massacure.
		- He says "You shouldn't have killed those natives"
		- When the tracker is chained up, the Veteran also apolagises to him, saying "Sorry" to the tracker, 
	- The Follower also initially seems hesitant to engage in the mistreatment of the aboriginal people. Only partiicpating in it after both *the tracker* and *the fanatic* have done so as-well, kind of like he is awaiting their approval.
This demonstrates the theme of **Justice & Morality** through the clear sense of morals these people appear to possess at a fundamental level, they don't, with the exception of *the fanatic*, ***enjoy*** mercilessly killing aboriginal people.

###### Hanging Scene
- The Theme of Justice & Morality can be seen in the juxtaposition of the 



###### Why the follower questions the tracker
in [[Tracker Analysis#[The Follower questions the tracker ](https //clickv.ie/w/n7Pv)|the scene where the follower questions the tracker's tracking abilities]], (pebble scene) the follower takes an assertive, *fanatic-like* stance, while critiscizing the tracker, accusing him of "following his nose", and that "anyone could see he's not really tracking", the follower mirrors the fanatic's as a result of his inexperience in the field, causing him to lean on the Fanatic as a role model. However, he backs down from this position after the tracker proves his abilities, from this point morals guide most of the followers decisions, he does not seek the external validation of *the fanatic*, like when he threatens to shoto the fanatic since he is "shooting innocent women and children" [[Tracker Analysis#The Second Massacure|in the second massacure]].
