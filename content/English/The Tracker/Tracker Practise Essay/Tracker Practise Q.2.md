>[!question] Discuss *the way* in which at least one studied text has <u>manipulated aspects of <b>genre</b></u> for a <u>particular <b>purpose</b></u>.

##### **Purpose**
>The Purpose of the Tracker is to convey **the impact of colonoliasm** on the lives of Aboriginal Australians, as well as it's prevelance within 1922 Australia.
##### The Plan
- **Paintings subvert the western genre's violence trope**
	- They obscure violence with paintings
		- This atleast partially respects the aboriginal tradition of not depicitng the full images/naming of the dead.
			- Though it is also not really Aboriginal Styled paintings, could also be viewed as the deliberate disregard for their traditions of avoiding the concept of death as a whole.
		- [[Extradiagetic Audio]] during the painting scenes
- **The Cast subverts western genre's protagonist trope**
	- Protagonists, The Tracker / The follower (sort of), Neither fit the western archetype. 
		  [according to this website](https://classicwestern.wordpress.com/2015/03/13/the-classic-western-protagonist-archetype/), a Western's Protagonist is; "Strong-willed, Individualistic with a temper that can not be tamed, keen to defend  himself and his interests."
		- neither *the Tracker* nor *Follower* fit that description fully.
		- The description much more aptly defines *the fanatic*.
	- The Follower (& veteran) especially show how ordinary people participated in the harmful acts of colonialism, shows how far it reached.
### Introduction
Westerns are a portal to a foreign past, they allow a Director to convey their view of society as it was. Rolf De Heer did just this in his notorious 2002 Western; "**The Tracker**". Set in 1922, the film chronicles a unnamed group of whites, led by *the Tracker* through the Aussie outback in search of a Aboriginal accused of murder. Throughout the generic conventions of a Western are subverted to convey the impact of the colonoliasm on the lives of Aboriginal Australians, as well as the prevelance of Racism within white 1922 Australia.

### BP 1 - Paintings
Westerns as a whole are known for their bold embrace of violence. The tracker is no exception, it *depicts* "Innocent women and children" being shot by the film's protagonists, where it differs is it's presentation of these massacures. The instant before significant events, mainly those involving death or violence, the screen always cuts to a painting depicting what *happened*, Diagetic Audio from the environment becomes Extradiagetic as we hear the events play out. This takes the Viewer out of the Action, conveying a clear indication of the events importance.
