[[Tracker Analysis#The Second Massacure|The Second Massacure for language Features]]

Aboriginal Spirit has endured for millenia, religion, culture, families, their spiritual connection with the land, all up until colonisation. The british, ironically those who claimed to bring civility to Australia were the cause, stealing aboriginal children, hanging aboriginal elders. Rolf De Heer, in his crticialy acclaimed film "*The Tracker*" (2002), positions the viewer to reject the colonial values of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">justice</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">white superiority</mark>, and move towards the acceptance of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">equality</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">forgiveness</mark>. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">As well as to <b>reject</b> the Dehumanizing and Oppressive Attitude</mark> that *the fanatic*, a white colonist, has towards *The Tracker*. through the masterful use of language features like <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Diction, Verbal Irony, and Symbolism</mark>. Throughout the film we see an group of whites, led by an aboriginal man hereafter referred to as *the tracker*, who assists them in locating a aboriginal accused of murder so that he can be sent for his time on the noose.

Throughout *The Tracker*, the viewer is presented with values relevant to 1922 Australia through Heer's use of Generalisation. We see *the Fanatic* present his valeus of White superioty when he refers to the aboriginal people generically when he says "You need to be firm with the natives" or "They're cannibals, very treaturous!", he never refers to them in specific terms, never attributing a wrong-doing to one person in particular rather oppressing, and dehumanising their whole race. The viewer is positioned to reject this notion as through the immediate push-back and contrition of other characters involved, when *the Tracker* is chained up *the Veteran* says he is sorry, when *the Follower* questions the tracker's motives, he says he is sorry, the viewer is positioned through the contrition showed by other characters to understand that *the Fanatic*'s actions are morally incorrect, and reject the dehumanising and oppressive attitude he displays towards the aboriginal people.

>The group's commander, *the Fanatic* prominantly influences the rest of the group to act in Dehumanizing and Oppressive ways, such as during the First Massacure, when both *the fanatic* and *the Follower* murdered innocent aboriginal Tribesman. *The Follower* himself being represented as innocent and much more familiar to a contemporary viewer such as myself, up until the point of him murdering aboriginals himself.

We see how the value of racism & white superiority is engrained into 1922 society when *the follower* jokingly joins in with the Fanatic in the interrogation of the aboriginals just prior to the first massacure. With all the aboriginals helpless, stood in a line, he takes on a childish and naive tone exclaiming things like "Your hat, is vey similar to my hat!" to which the aboriginals are simply powerless. Music at a high volume drowns out the majority of background sound, pulling me, the viewer, out of what is happening on screen.
In an instant the music cuts out, we go from a close-up of an aboriginal elder with a gun pushed against his tongue, to a still-shot of a painting depicting *the fanatic* as salience in the center shooting through a tongue, and the follower shooting through a aboriginal women's chest. The Juxtaposition of the gunshots to the music, forces the viewer's full attention, we see what racism and blatent white superiority has done
