"Compare" references how candidates must discuss similarities and/or diffferences and evaluating the *effect* of the anguage features associated wit different modes on how empathy for an individual group has been invited or encouraged

- "Empathy" is the ability to under/share feelings of another. 
- "To invite" means consider the *purpose*/*intent*, of how Empathy is generated
- Stronger responses make referecne to relationship to the values of chosen texts & empathetic individuals/groups they represent.
- Consideration of the role of authors context may also help

-  State who the "particular individual or group" is.
- Stronger responses; How the text constructs representations of such individuals or groups.
	- (whether they talk about the same group or not.)
- Mode = Various proceses of communication; 
  Listening, speaking, 'reading/viewing' and writing / creating
  Also refers to "Print" / "Image" / "Gesture" / etc.

#### Explain how at least one text has transformed or adapted genre to alter an audiences attitude towards an issue or concept

- Explore the studied text's generic elements has been transformed to "influence" the audience
- Identify how attitude is targeted by the text's generic alterations, explain the resulting response from the audience
- "Audience Attitude" is either the dominant reading, or you identifying yourself as the audience
- 
  Concept = 'abstract idea'. 
  Issue = Personal / public concern.
- Articulate How Generic Features shape attitudes
	- Either due to conventions in a genre
		- e.g. representation of love through visual language in a feature film as opposed to a short story.
	- Or due to how nature & style of a genre shape represenation of a concept, as opposed to how another gnere does.
