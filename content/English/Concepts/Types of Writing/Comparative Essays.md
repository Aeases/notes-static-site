>>##### Block Approach
>>Discuss the first text, then in your discussion of the second text draw points of comparison to the first text, which, if possible in the time frame, are further discussed in a third paragraph.
>
>>[!abstract] The **Block Approach** - [[Sample Comparative Block or Alternating Body Paragraphs|Example]]
>> Paragraph 1: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color: black">Text 1</mark>, **1st** point of difference / similarity
>> Paragraph 2: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color: black">Text 1</mark>, ***2nd*** point of difference / similarity
>> Paragraph 3: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color: black">Text 2</mark>, **1st** point of difference / similarity
>> Paragraph 4: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color: black">Text 2</mark>, ***2nd*** point of difference / similarity

>>##### Alternating Approach
>>Alternate between texts, Sequence your paragraphs in terms of points of comparison that you want to highlight. use [[Comparative Language]] to *signpost each new point*, which represents a similarity or difference between texts.

>>[!abstract|wide-2] The **Alternating Approach** - [[Sample Comparative Block or Alternating Body Paragraphs|Example]]
>> Paragraph 1: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color: black">Text 1</mark>, **1st** point of difference / similarity
>> Paragraph 2: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color: black">Text 2</mark>, ***2nd*** point of difference / similarity
>> Paragraph 3: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color: black">Text 1</mark>, **1st** point of difference / similarity

>>[!blank|wide-2]
>>##### Integrated Approach [[Sample Comparative Approaching paragraphs|Example]]
>>In an integrated essay comparison occurs between each text in every paragraph, each body paragraph focuses on an aspect of the main theme or issue in the given question. This can be a good approach for timed essays, as comparison begins in the very first paragraph.
>
>>[!abstract] The **Integrated Approach**
>>Paragraph 1: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color:black">Text 1</mark> & <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color:black">Text 2</mark>, 
>>**1st** point of Similarities / Diff.
>>Paragraph 2: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color:black">Text 1</mark> & <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color:black">Text 2</mark>, 
>>**2nd** point of Similarities / Diff.
>>Paragraph 3: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6; color:black">Text 1</mark> & <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6; color:black">Text 2</mark>, 
>>**3rd** point of Similarities / Diff.
