Attitudes can be *towards* many different things, e.g. 
- towards "the act of playing babysitter",
- towards "her responsibility for her brothers welfare"
### How are Attitudes Conveyed?
- Attitudes are conveyed through [[Diction|Lexical Choices]].
- Attitudes can be revealed in characters.
	- [[Voice]]
		- Their [[Tone]]
	- [[Speech]]
	- [[Body Language]]
	- **Facial Expressions**
###### Attitudes as a [[Viewpoint]]
- The central character demonstrates the attitude that she is **desperate to be free of the restrictive responsibility** for her younger brother's welfare
###### Attitudes as a way of thinking / feeling towards something
- The central character demonstrates a **resentful** and **dismissive** attitude towards her responsibility for her younger brother's welfare


>[!warning]+ you can not have an "attitude of racism", or a "negative attitude towards racism" it must have a **descriptor**.
>- A ***rebellious attitude* towards playing the role of babysitter**
>- Rather, it's an a ***critical attitude** towards the past attrocities and their impacts on First Nations People*, 
>- 
>- or a ***Intolerant attitude** towards the self-serving fossil fuel companies provoking climate change*.
