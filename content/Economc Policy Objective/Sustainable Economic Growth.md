>[!cite] Sustainable Economic Growth
Maintaining a level of economic growth that is "Sustainable" meaning it is **3** to **3.5** per cent.
This avoids the overutilisation of resources that lead to things like climate change. *sustainable* for us is *~3% p.a*.
Indicator:
[[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]
Formula
*Real GDP* = $C+I+G+(X-M)$

This helps us (a developed economy) avoid unsustainable growth that puts too much pressure "factor markets" (raw materials and labour)

#### Potential Growth
Potential Growth is determined by;
- Growth in the labour force
- Growth in Productivity
$$\text{Labour Force Growth} + \text{Productivity Growth}=\boxed{Potential \text{ } Growth}$$
>[!warning] The Actual Rate of growth depends on the level of aggregate demand at any point in time.
