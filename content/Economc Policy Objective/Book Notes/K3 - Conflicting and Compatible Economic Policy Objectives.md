  - Economic Objectives - Conflict & Compatibility

There is conflict between *some* [[Economc Policy Objective]]s and the [[Central Economic Problem]].

Some [[Economc Policy Objective|Economic Objectives]] are "*compatible*" with one another, meaning that a increase in one does not harm, or even helps the other.

#### Compatible Policy Objectives
##### *[[Economic Growth]]* & *[[Full Employment]]*
Growth creates demand for G&S, and thus the resources  used in production. Economic Growth improves material welfare, so aggregate demand will rise. which in-turn produces more growth as it provides stimulus. The fuller full employment, the closer to full potential an economy operates.
##### *[[Full Employment]]* & *Equitable Income Distribution*
Policies that lower ***un***employment should also **improve income distribution**.
This is because, *ceteris paribus*,more people with jobs, provides households more income to consume, save, and build wealth.
##### [[Price Stability]] & [[Economic Growth]]
Maintaining consistant and sustainable *Economic Growth* requires control of **Inflation**, control of inflation in turn improves *Price Stabiliy*.
- ##### Efficient Resoruce Allocation, [[Productivity]], and [[Economic Growth]]
Efficient allocation of resources **improves Efficiency & Productivity**,this in turn increases long-run aggregate supply, lowering the cost of supply, and reducing inflatioanry pressure, in turn helping Price stability as well.

#### Conflicting Policy Objectives
- ##### [[Price Stability]] and [[Full Employment]]
Policies that reduce demand pull inflation generally reduce economic gactivity as a whole. This reduces the demand for labour as a whole since there is less demand.
In the opposite direction, **expanding economic activity** to improve unemployment puts upwards pressure on available resources and prices.
- ##### [[Economic Growth]] & [[Price Stability]]
A booming economy places **demand-side pressure** on resources **as it nears capacity**.
This leads to *inflationary pressure as competition for resources pushes up prices*.
- ##### [[Economic Growth]] & [[Unemployment#Structural Unemployment|Structural Unemployment]]
Growth is associated with structural change. 
*drastic decline* in some sectors of the economy, cause structural unemployment.
- ##### [[Economic Growth]] & ***Equitable Income Distribution***
Economic growth increases total GDP, though, *especially in the short term*, People employed in expanding sectors get more,
Owners of these industries get disproportionality more since shares tend to gain in relative terms to their wealth.
