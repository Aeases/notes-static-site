# Types of Time Lag

#### Recognition Lag
The amount of time it takes before Policy makers *recognise* what is happening at a macro-level.
- Economic Statistics are always out of date. Most often by ~3 months, can get as low as around 1 month. Thus Recognition is behind by this time-frame too.
#### Decision Lag
The lag between when Policy makers *recognise* a macro-level change, and when they actually *enact* new policy to resolve it. 
 - In [[Monetary Policy]], there is **short decision Lag**.
	 - The Decisions are made on the Tuesday of Every Month
 - In [[Fiscal Policy]] there is much **longer decision lag**.
	 - Decisions are made at may at budget release, or in the Nov-Jan Adjustment period if extremely necessary. Budget must also be approved by **both houses of Parliment**.
#### Effect Lag
The time it takes for **Policy Decisions** to have an effect on household and business behaviour.
- **Fiscal Policy** - â¬‡Tax > ðŸ ± Disposible Income, If they spend, ðŸ ±Consumption Spending > ðŸ ±Income > ðŸ ±Consumption (Multiplier) & ðŸ ±Output as firms react to higher orders.
	- Takes months for this effect lag to occur, until it has we do not know the full impact of this policy change.
- **Monetary Policy** - â¬‡Cash Rate >>>>>> Takes time for banks to pass on reduction *meaning*, it takes time for households & businesses to react to â¬‡Cash Rate.
	- e.g. could take 2-3 **YEARS** for a fixed interest rate household  to switch to new repayments.
	- â¬‡Interest Rates has low impact when economic activity & confidence are low (like recession)
