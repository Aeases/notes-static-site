### Definition
>[!cite] Bipartite Graphs
>**Bipartite Graphs** are graphs whose [[Vertex|Verticies]] can be split into **distinct** sets, a.k.a *each [[Vertex]] does not have a [[Edge]] that connects to it to another [[Vertex]] of the **same** set as it.*
>
>It is a **Complete Bipartite Graph** if every member of one set is connected to every member of the other set.

Take the nubmer of verticies in the first group and times it with the nubmer of verticies in the second group.

>[!warning]
>Dont call the nodes in each set "not Interconnected"
