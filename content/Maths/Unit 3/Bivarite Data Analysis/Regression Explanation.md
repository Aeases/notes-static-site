in a mathematical context, describe regression



Regression is a statistical technique used in mathematics to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to develop a mathematical model that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. The aim of regression is to find the best fit line or curve that represents the relationship between the variables, so that it can be used to make predictions about future data points. Regression analysis involves calculating various statistical measures such as correlation coefficient, slope, intercept and standard error to determine how well the model fits the data.
