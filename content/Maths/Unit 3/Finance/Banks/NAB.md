### Advantages of Unsecured Loan
- Avoiding dealer finance might help you save on extra fees, commissions, or high-interest rates.
- As long as the primary loan purpose is the purchase of the car, you can use any remaining funds for other purchases.
- You’ll own the car straight away because an unsecured loan doesn’t use your car as collateral.
