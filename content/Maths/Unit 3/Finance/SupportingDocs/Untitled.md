To get a pre-tax yearly income I can calculate the weekly wage with an assumed number of working hours per week, I can then work out my yearly wage ($Y$) by multiplying the weekly wage by the number of weeks in the year.

###### Special Rates
I will include in the weekly wage the regular, re-occuring Benefits I accrue within each weekly period, this being the penalty benefits for working on Saturdays & Sundays.

Below is a table depicting my chosen Hourly worktime, alongside the Penalty Rates where applicable.

| Day       | Hours | Penalty Benefit |
| --------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Monday    | 4h    | 100%            |
| Friday | 4h    | 100%            |
| Saturday   | 6h    | 150%            |
| Sunday          | 4h      | 200%                 |
Given that I'm paid bi-weekly, and earn an hourly wage of $25, 
I can use this formula to 
$$(W \times H)+(1.5W \times H_{Sat})+(2W \times H_{Sun})=Y_{Weekly}$$
Where;
W = Hourly **W**age
$H$ = Weekday **H**ours worked | $8h=(4h_{Mon}+4h_{Fri})$
$H_{\text{Sat}}$ = **Sat**urday **H**ours worked | $6h$
$H_{\text{Sun}}$ = **Sun**day **H**ours worked | $4h$

Plugging in my values gets me;

$$
\begin{aligned} 
(W \times H)+(1.5W \times H_{Sat})+(2W \times H_{Sun}) &= Y_{Week} \\ 
(25 \times 8) + (25 \times 1.5 \times 6) + (25 \times 2 \times 4) &= Y_{Week} \\
200 + 225 + 200 &= Y_{Week} \\
625 &= Y_{Week}
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus my weekly income is **$625**.
Next I can turn this weekly income into a Yearly Income, pre-tax, and pre-public holiday benefits by just multiplying it by 52.14, as follows **$625 \times 52.14=32587.5$**. Thus, $Y=32587.5$, where $Y$ is Yearly Income.

> [!bug]- Public Holidays - Archived
> ###### Public Holidays
> Now for public holidays, the public holiday rate is similar to the Penalty Payments calculated in the weekly payments, *however*, since they only occur sparcisely, and in no particular pattern, they must be added on after.
> According to [this government website](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/labour-relations/public-holidays-western-australia), there are 11 public holidays recognised per year in western Australia, each one consistently provides a 250% income boost. Personally, I wouldn't like to work on New Years, Christmas, or Boxing day, since I'd rather be up with Family, thus I'll count 8 Public Holidays as working days, on which I'll work 8 hours, despite whether if it's a Weekend or Weekday since University doesn't run on Public Holidays.
> Of the first year, there is only one day that is a saturday, thus the rest are weekdays,

##### Wage Growth

According to the [Australia Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/wages-increase-08-cent-june-quarter#:~:text=The%20Wage%20Price%20Index%20(WPI,wages%20grew%200.8%20per%20cent.), Wage Growth is averaged at around **3.6%**, if we assume that this is maintained throughout the next 5 years, we can construct a Explicit Geometric Sequence, where $n$ represents how many year's it has been since we took on the loan.
$$T_{n} = 32587.5 \times 1.036^{n-1}$$
![[Pasted image 20230817212347.png]]
Full Values;
$$
\begin{aligned}
T_1 &= \$32587.5 \\
T_2 &= \$33760.65 \\
T_3 &= \$34976.03 \\
T_4 &= \$36235.17 \\
T_5 &= \$37539.64 \quad (\$37539.636) 
\end{aligned}
