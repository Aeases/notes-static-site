>[!cite] Annuities
>Things like super, or the "complete opposite of a compound interest loan", where you accrue money via interest, and contnually withdraw money from that. Usually until it goes down to 0

You can use the exact same sequence to calculate Annuities as is done with Reducing Balance Loans.


Using Classpad Finance App:

N = Terms
I% = Interest
PV = The initial investment (**Negative**, it is going *out of your account*)
PMT = Take out per-term (**Positive**, since you are taking money out of the account)


-28915.98

For finding the total amount of interest earned other an annuities lifetime;
1. Find the total payed / retrieved from the annuitiy, this is the payment per period, ($PMT$) multiplied by the number of periods ($N$)
$$PMT \times N$$
2. then take away the final payment, this will get you the total amount paid out from the loan, including the amount paid out as a resut of your initial investment that we wil remove later.
$$(PMT \times N)-\text{Final Payment}$$
(Final payment is the first negative value in the sequence, you can also find it by adding the first negative and the last positive i think)
3. You now have the total amount of money retrieved from the loan, take out your initial investment, leaving you with the interest.
$$\text{Total Amount Paid Out} - \text{PV}$$
PV is the principal, PV stands for Present Value at the beginning of the loan.
