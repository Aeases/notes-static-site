*Simple* Interest: 
$$I=Prt$$
Where;
	I = Interest Amount over time period
	P = *Principal*
	r = Interest Rate
	t = Time period
could also be a [[Arithmetic Sequences|Arithmetic Relation]] $T_{n+1} = Tn+d$ 

*Compound Interest*
$$A=P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{Nt}$$
Where;
A = Actual Amount in bank
P = *Principal*
r = Interest Rate
t = Time Period
Could also be expressed as a [[Geometric Sequence|Geometric Relation]]
$$T_{n+1}=(1+\frac{r}{N})T_n$$
N = Term Value
n = Term Index

**Both** could either be first-order-linear recurrance relation (**recurrance**) *or*  **explicit**.

# Repayments

>[!warning]
>If it says payments are made at the end of the year, a years worth of interest will accrue between each term. different amount at start of year to amount paid at the end of the year.

>[!warning] MAKE SURE TO PUT REPAYMENTS GOING OUT AS NEGATIVE (LIKE LOAN), 
>AND GOING INTO UR BANK ACCOUNT POSITIVE (LIKE ANNUITIES)


### Amortisation
The amortisation app allows you to calculate between a 2 *specific payments*

INT = amount of interest paid in first payment
$\Sigma INT$ = total amount of interest paid over the loan


>[!warning]+ Make sure to change it to "Begin" if payments are made at the beginning of the month
