##### Example

Christian borrows 100,000 at 8% per annum compounding monthly, to be repaid over 10 years with repayments of 1213.28 each month. After 5 years, the interest rate is reduced to 7.5% per annum.

N = $10 \times 12$
I% = $8$
PV = $100000$
PMT = $-1213.28$
FV = ? >>> $0.742$ < this is not 0 due to **overpayment**
P/y = 12
C/y = 12
