N = Number of installment periods
	If P/Y represents **years**, then N must be in terms of **years**
I% = **Annual** Interest Rate
	Interest Rate given in question (dont have to do anything to it)
PV = **Principal**
	If gaining money, Positive value
	If giving / losing money, Negative Value
P/Y = **Installment** Periods
	 (Number of **payments** to pay off the loan, not how often it compounds)
	 If N represents years, then P/Y must represent *what it would be* if it where in years. even if your calculating in months.
PMT = Payments each period (only matters with reducible interest)
C/Y = **Compound** Periods
	how many times it compounds

>[!example] Example
>April takes out a \$20,000 loan (she gains \$20,000) , she is charged **7.99%** interest, compounding daily, but payed weekly. Payed over 8 years.
>
>I% = **7.99%**
>PV = \$20,000
>P/Y = 52 
>C/Y = 365
>N = $8 \times 52$

##### Calculating Final Payment
$$FP=PMT-T_{n}$$
Where:
$T_n$ = The first term where **the value is negative**
$PMT$ = The amount payed each period
##### Calculating Total Payment
$$PMT \times N -FP$$
Where:
PMT = Amount payed each period
N = Number of periods
FP = Final Payment
##### Calculating amount of interest paid
$$$$
1. Calculate the total amount of the loan that has been paid off
$$A_{\text{Paid off}}=PV-FV$$
Where:
PV = Principal Value
FV = Final Value

2. Calculate how much has been paid over those periods
$$T_{\text{paid}} = N \times PMT$$
Where:
N = Number of periods
PMT = Amount paid off every period
3. Take the two
$$T_{\text{Interest Paid}} = T_{\text{paid}} + A_{\text{paid}}$$
