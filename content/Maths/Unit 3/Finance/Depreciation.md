#### Methods of Calculating Depreciation
- Straight-line / Prime-cost / Flat Rate method
- Unit Cost method
- Reducing / Declining / Diminishing balance method


>[!warning]
>for the love of god take the thing out of $T_x=y$ and put it into dollers or whatever the context is. is a good idea to surround it with a box too, e.g. $$T_x=400, \quad \boxed{\$400}$$



### Flat Rate  (Simple Interest)
In this method the value decreases *lineraly* (by a fixed amount) each year. the amont it loses per year does not change. the cost is "spread out evenly acros it's lifespan"

$$\frac{Cost-\text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful life of the 
asset}}=\text{Per Year Depreciation Amount}$$
Where;
Residual Value = The minimum possible value of the asset
Cost = The *initial* cost of the asset
Useful life of the asset (in terms of years / the context prob)


This can be modelled with a [[Arithmetic Sequences]] 
e.g. $T_n=a+(n-1)d$ 
Where: $d$ = amount lost per year, $a$ = Principal, $n$ = number of years
>[!example]-
>A Production machine costs \$500,000 it's useful like will end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. It's scrap / residual value is \$20,000, and the machine produces 10,000 units per year.
>a) What is the annual depreciation
>$$\frac{Cost - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful life of the asset}}=\frac{500,000 - 20,000}{(240,000 \div 10000)}=\text{\$20,000 Per Year}$$

### Unit Cost (based on usage)
e.g. The amount of k's on your car, or hours the product was used for.

$$\text{Depreciation p/unit}=\frac{Cost-\text{Residual Value}}{\text{\color{green}Total number of units produced}}$$

>[!example]- A Machine with value **$\$330,000$**, and Residual Value of **$\$50,000$** produces **10,000** units a year, and **140,000** in it's lifetime. Calculate the depreciation expense for the first year and the book value of the machinery after the first year.
>
$$ \text{ Dep. Cost p/unit}= \frac{330,000-50,000}{140,000}=\color{green}\$2 \text{ p/Unit}$$
$$2 \times 10,000= \boxed{\$20,000} \text{ <- Depreciation Expense}$$
$$\$330,000 - \$20,000 = \boxed{\$310,000} \text{ <- Book Value Aft. 1y}$$
