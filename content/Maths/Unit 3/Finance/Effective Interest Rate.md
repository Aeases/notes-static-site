#### Effective Interest Rate
We "*standardise*" the period so that we can calculate a percentage value that the interest will increase by in a specified term, we can then use that on the principal to get a value
$$I_{effective}=(1+\frac{R}{n})^n - 1 $$
**do not have to do this sequence manually**, *can use finance app on classpad*.

The nominal rate of **x**% when compounded monthly is equivalent to an interest rate of **y**% when compounded annually.
