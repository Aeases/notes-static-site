**The Mathematical Thinking Process**
The steps are as follows:
- interpret the task and gather the key information
- identify the mathematics which could help to complete the task
- analyse information and data from a variety of sources
- apply existing mathematical knowledge and strategies to obtain a solution
- verify the reasonableness of the solution
- communicate findings in a systematic and concise manner.
