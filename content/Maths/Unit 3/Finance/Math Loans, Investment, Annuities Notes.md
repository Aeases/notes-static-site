# Compounding Loans

Example Recurrance Relation;

$$T_{n+1} = T_n \times (1+\frac{Interest}{Compounds})$$

# Depreciation

Example Explicit Sequence used when finding the depreciation rate;
$$12310=18375 \times y^3$$
Solve for y, gets $y=0.8750043$, then must take that from 1 to get the depreciation rate, $1-0.8750043 = 0.125 = \boxed{12.5\%}$.
