### Secular Trend
Trends that repeat over a long time. (e.g. like over 7 years, not every "season" if it repeats every season it is a seasonal trend)

### Seasonal Trend
[[Seasonal Pattern]]s are similar to a [[#Cyclic Patterns]], however they **must be** *regular*. and repeat every "season"

This graph is seasonal because we can see that every 7 days the pattern repeats
### Cyclic Patterns
[[Cyclic Pattern]] are patterns where there are periodic movements in a [[Time Series]]. **They do not have to be regular**.

#### Reliability
In time series you can extrapolate within **1 cycle** of your last value. Even if it is an **extrapolation**.
This is because time series are only useful if you extrapolate outside.



### Irregular / Random Patterns
