## Basic Hungarian Algorithm

![[Hungarian Algorithm 2023-09-11 10.01.11.excalidraw|100%]]
#### Steps 
1. Row Reduction
	- Find the Lowest Value in a column
	- Take the value of the smallest number in the row, subtract it from every number in that row.

2. Column Reduction

3. **if** the numberof lines is ***not equal*** to the number of columns/rows
	- Find the smallest uncovered number
	- Take the value of the smallest covered number;
		- Add the number to the intersection numbers
		- Remove the value of the number to the uncovered numbers.
	- 

4. Construct a [[Bipartite Graphs|Bipartite Graph]] 
	- Use [[Allocation]] of a Bipartite graph to find the vallues associated with the specific value in the original matrix.


## Variations of Hungarian Algorithm

### Number of People â‰  Number of Tasks

We add a dummy row / dummy column such that the number of columns and rows is the same.





### Alocating for a maximum
- Find the **largest** number in the table
- Take the value of the largest number, and replace every element $x$ from the largest number $m$. so it would look klike $x-m$ where x is the element you are currently replacing

Then continue as usual with the Hungarian Algorithm, e.g. row reduction, then column etc etc.

>There can be questions where it's a maximum & the number of people doesnt equal the number of tasks


>Zeros go in first then you maximise by swaping out the numbers for x and taking largest number m
