>[!cite] Explicit Sequences
>As opposed to [[Recursive Sequences]], explicit sequences do not take in the previous value, they can be computed using purely the function provided and the value of *n* value of the sequence.

>[!success]
>Explicit Sequences can be worked out algebraically, as each value in the function is constant and is not dependant on the term of the sequence.
