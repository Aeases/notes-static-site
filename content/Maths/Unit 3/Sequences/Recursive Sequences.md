### Definition
>[!cite] Recursive Sequences
Recurrance Relation, or Recursive Sequences use [[Recursion]] in that they refer to a sequence where the previous number in the sequence is used to produce the next number.

>[!warning]
>Recursive Sequences can not be worked out [[Explicit Sequences|explictly]].

Recursive Sequences require a starting value, since they refer to the value right before them, they requrie manual intervention to begin.

#### Recursive Sequence Formula
$$T_{n+1}=rT_n+d$$


#### Working out next value of Term with previus value
$$T_{n+1}$$Refers to the '*nth*', value, n can be substituted for anything, e.g. to find 6th value $T_{5+1}$, because the result of this is $T_{6}$

Usually this will 'equal' something, e.g.
$$T_{n+1}=T_n + 6$$
This equation is saying that the term after the term n ($T_{n+1}$) is equal to the value of $T_n+6$, or the previous value + 6 since the Sequence increases by 6 each term

#### Example
The population of Desert Scrubrats is decreasing y 15% each year if the population is initially 1200, write a recursive formula for the scrubrat population.
$$T_{n+1}= T_n \times 0.85$$
