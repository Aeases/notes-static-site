>[!cite] Flat Rate Loans
>In Flat Rate Loans, Interest is calculated using the [[Simple Interest#Simple Interest Formula|Simple Interest Formula]], you calculate the full term of the loan at once. Interest is spread evenly about all the loan repayments.

>[!danger]
>**Remember**, Simple Interest compounds **ONCE**, meaning you should only ever take a percentage on the Initial Simple Interest value, and never again. Instead of 5% of the amount it changes to a constant, $SI$.

>TL;DR **never touch *$r$* again after calculating *$SI$***

### Finding Total Interest
Use the [[Simple Interest#Simple Interest Formula|Simple Interest Formula]].
$$SI=Prn$$
$P$ = Principal
$r$ = Rate
$n$ = Time Period

### Finding Per-Repayment Amount

##### Tranditional (Given $P$, $SI$ & Repayments)
$$\frac{P+SI}{\text{Number of Repayments}}$$
Where:
$P$ = Principal
$SI$ = Simple Interest
$\text{Number of Repayments}$ = the amount of monthly repayments, (check indent)
	e.g. If $SI$ was calculated with $n=2$ (2 years), with monthly repayments in those two years, this value is $n \times 12$ to get the amount of months in the Simple Interest formula.


##### [[Arithmetic Sequences|Arithmetic]] (Given Common Difference)
![[Arithmetic Sequences#(* Explicit Sequences Explicit *) Arithmetic Sequence / Relation Formula]]
Given atleast 2 Terms of the Sequence, we can use the **Alternative Formula for Difference** to calculate $d$, and then use the first term of the sequence as $a$

###### Example
4032, 3864, 3696
$4032-3864=d=168$
$4032$ is the first, therefore $a = 4032$
sub into $T_n=a+(n-1)d$, to get:
*$T_n=4032+(n-1)\times 168$*
