### Definition
>[!cite] Arithmetic Sequence / Relations
>A  Sequence where each term has a common difference, e.g. each term increases by 5 each time.
>It can also a [[First Order Linear Recurrence Relation]]
>It is linear when plottoned on a graph

#### (*[[Explicit Sequences|Explicit]]*) Arithmetic Sequence / Relation Formula
$$T_n=a+(n-1)d$$
Where:
$a$ is a *Absolute Value* ($T_1$)
$d$ is the *Difference*
**Alternative Formula for Difference**: $d=T_n-T_{n-1}$
>[!note] If $a$ should = $T_0$
>Then use the alternate formula without the $-1$
>e.g. $T_n=a+ (n)d$

#### (*[[First Order Linear Recurrence Relation|First-Order Recurrance]]*) Arithmetic Sequence / Relation Formula
$$T_{n+1}=T_n+d$$
Where:
$a$ is the *First Value* ($T_1$) $^{\text{  yes equation correct \^\ }}$
$d$ is the *Common Difference*
	if *$D=0$ it's constant*, $D > 0$ it's increasing, $D < 0$ it's decreasing

>[!note]- First Order Arithmetic Sequence Notes
>- D > 0  : Increasing Sequence
>- D < 0  : Decreasing Sequence
>- D = 0 : Constant Sequence

>- The Recurrance relation for any arithmetic sequence $T_{n+1}=T_n+d$, $T_1=a$ may be written in the form: $T_n=T_{n-1}+d$, $T_1=a$

>[!warning] this is another way of wirtiing the exact same Explicit Arithmetic Sequence formula;
>$$a+d(n-1)$$
