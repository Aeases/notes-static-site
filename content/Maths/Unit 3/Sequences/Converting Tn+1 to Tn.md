$$T_{n+1} = 2T_n+5$$
Rearrange the equation to solve for $T_n$
$$T_n=\frac{T_{n+1}+5}{2}$$
Given that the value you want to find $T_{n}$ and you have the value above it $T_{n+1}$ you can find the value before it, e.g. you have $T_4$ and want to find $T_3$. $T_4$ becomes $T_{n+1}$ and $T_3$ is $T_{n}$.
