### Definition
>[!cite] Simple Interest
>Simple interest takes the value at the start of the investment, and never updates ([[Compound Interest|Compounds]]) the interest, e.g. $2000 invested at 10%, $200 is given on the first year, and it is still a flat $200 per year even on the fifth year.

#### Simple Interest Formula
$$SI=PrT$$
Where;
$SI$ = Simple Interest
$P$ = *P*rincipal 
	(Starting Amount)
$r$ = Interest *r*ate 
	in the context of $T$, e.g. 8.4% p.a. is *0.084 **if** $T$ is 1* year, but *$0.007$ **if** $T$ is 12 months*
$T$ = *T*ime Period 
	(how many years / months etc.)
