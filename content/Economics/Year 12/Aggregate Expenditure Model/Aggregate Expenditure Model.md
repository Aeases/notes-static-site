>[!warning]+ **What the Aggregate Expenditure Model *doesnt say*** ([[Chapter 10 - Aggregate Demand And Supply.pdf#page=1|source]])
>- AE Model focuses on the **impact** of a **change in spending on output**. (says nothing about impact of changing expenditure on general prices, therefore *does not* say anything about *inflation*)
>
>- AE Model only focuses on demand side of economy.
>	- Changes in labour force, Capital Stock, Level of Technology, Rising productivity not considered in AE Model

### The Consumption Function
![[Pasted image 20230613131209.png|300]]


Increases in Incomes will correlate to an increase in Savings and Consumption
**At baseline**, we still must consume to survive. therefore we borrow at some amount. (the -60 shown)

$$\text{Consumption}=\text{Autonomous Spending } + (\text{ Disposable Income }\times \text{M.P Consume})$$
$$Cf=a+bY_d$$
Where:
Cf = Consumption Function
a = [[Autonomous Spending]] is "Survival Spending" the minimum we must spend to **survive**. (***constantt***) 
$bY_d$ =  (***variable, depends on income/MPC***)
	$b$ = Marginal Propensity to Consume (**what percentage of your income you will spend**)
	$Y_d$ = Disposable Income (Income Formula $Y = C + S$)


$$\frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}=b$$


Savings Function
$$S=-a+sY_d$$
Where:
$S$ = Savings Function
-a = Autonomous dis-saving
$s$ = Marginal Propensity to save
$Y_d$ = Disposable Income

$s$ = $\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$

###### Graphing the model
![[Consumption Function.excalidraw|700]]

- If Aggregate Expenditure (Rise) on consumption line is greater than production, *Decrease in Inventory*, causing *increase in production*, causing an *increase in resources* (labour), causign an increase in *Income (& Savings)*, causing an increase in *consumption*. therefore we return to the start
(she wrote H/Hy on the board not increase in income, they are probaly the same)

Break-even point - point where Savings becomes positive rather than negative;
	*this moves further away as [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to Consume]] increases*, closer as [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to save]] increases.

As *Marginal propensity to consume* represents the **gradient** of the consumption function as demonstrated in the video below.

At Equilibrium, number of spending is equal to number of output and income, therefore we know the consumption function become this: $C_d=a+bC_d$ we can solve for $C_d$
