>>Hi Zane
>>
>>What you have done so far is pretty good. However, remember there are more than two influences on levels of business investment. I would deal with business expectations and low profitability as two separate factors. Low expectations e.g. business is expecting that high inflation may push the economy into an economy downturn as predicted by the International Monetary Fund and low profitability e.g. when firms hold low profits it means that they have less money to reinvest back into the firm.

>>What about government economic policy and risk?

Investment is a fundamental aspect of the Australian economy, it makes up 16-23% of Aggregate Expenditure, while simultaneously being the most volatile aspect of AE. Investment helps to fund our largest domestic industry, mining, and is a major driver of the movements in *the business cycle*. 

To slow down economic activity in a boom period, or fasten it during a Recovery, the RBA attempts to influence the economy, and Total Investment through manipulation of the **Cash Rate**, a negative relationship between Real Interest Rates and (planned) Investment exist since the I.R represents "*the price of borrowed money*" through the cost of periodic repayments.
In a high I.R environment Investment is discouraged since it "costs more" to take on the "good debt" necessary for investment. 
Addtionally I.R represents the *opportunity cost of money*, since a high I.R provides more, less risky, opportunities to utilise retained profit, e.g. Accumulating in a bank. If the prospective return from *capital investment* does not exceed the interest rate, and by a significant margin, re-investment into capital goods becomes less appealing due to their inherent risk.

**Risk** is a key determinant of investment, as companies invest in an effort to get the highest positive return possible, with a acceptable level of risk. Risk varies based on changes in various things, examples include; consumer sentiment, international events, and political decisions. Risk can be thought of as a *risk* to *reward* ratio, where significant risk can outweigh potential profitability, and significant profitablility can outweigh potential risk.

Change in **Government Policie**s on taxation change the *Expected Revenue*, and *production costs*, this can reduce incentives to invest as the potential reward is artificially reduced. On the otherhand Tax Incentives increase the appeal of investment in a industry that may have been too risky, or not profitable enough in the eyes of businesses prior.
Similarily, **profitability** influences total investment, if profitability is low businesses tend to slow investment into maintaining capital equipment. where as in times of high profitability, they usually re-invest that profit back into themselves to grow the business.
Finally, **Business Sentiment** influences investment decisions as companies may not be confident in the economies future. This can be influenced by perceived levels of economic activity,  the current levels of sales / leftover stock from previous purchases, and inquiries from buyers. *Business Sentiment* as a non-interest rate based factor, shifts the entire Investment-Demand curve, a curve describing the negative relationship between I.R and Demand for Investment, this can affect that relationship, as occured in September 2017, 2022 where despite historic interest rate lows, we saw below-average investment as a result of low Business Sentiment during this time-period.


>mention government policies influences (see [[H2 - Determinants - Influences of Aggregate Expenditure#Government Policies Influences on "Elasticity of Investment"]])





"Importance of Investment to Australian Economy"
- Investment Drives production and thus the business cycle
- Investment is a volatile factor of AE contributing between 16-23%
- "Elasticity of Investment" (investment can push economy into inflation forcing intervention from investment influences)
- influences like interest rate
	- Interest Rate & Investment Negative Relationship
	- Interest Rate increases the **opportunity cost** of money.
	- Capital Investment must be a lot more profitable, otherwise the risk of capital inv. is not worth the payoff.
- Sentiment
	- Bad Busienss Expectations = less investment
	- Less Investment = Decrease Economic Activity


> Mention specifics to Australian Economy, e..g. Investment is important due to mining industry, 
> - Importance only needs 2-3 sentences

>- The Importance of investment is not *effects / benefits of investment* though there is overlap

Investment is important to the Australian economy because *Investment **Spending** drives production*, Investment as a whole makes up 16-23% of Aggregate Expenditure, and in turn GDP, Investment is very receptive to Consumer & Business sentiment, if there is expectations of a troubling economic future we will have a low **Elasticity of Investment**, meaning companies may not be willing to take on the Capital Investment neccessary to drive production, ultimately investing their money not into capital, but instead into something more reliable. 


to it's volatility investment changes alot making it a very important factor *driving the business cycle*, when investment is high we are usually in a boom, unemployment is low, Consumer Spending is high, and aggregate expenditure is hitting it's 3% target, overall the economy is in a good state.

> 
> The multiplier effect occurs when an initial increase in investment spending leads to a greater than proportional increase in income throughout the economy. This is because one person's spending becomes another person's income, creating a cycle of increased consumption and further economic activity.
> 
> Let's assume that there is an initial increase in mining energy investment worth $50 million. We can calculate the multiplier by using the equation: Multiplier = 1 / Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS). The MPS represents leakages from the circular flow of income, such as savings or imports.

The mining industry is extremely capitally expensive, it requires extremely expensive machinary & skilled workers to operate at peak efficiency, and thus a huge amount of investment. Due to an economic process called the "Multiplier Effect" the dollar value impact of these investments flows through the economy providing a greater than proportional increase in income for the economy as a whole. 
This occurs  since "One man's spending is another man's income", eventually, that initial Investment of $50b will enter the income of many different workers, they will then spend a portion of that re-injecting a portion of that $50b back as consumption, and since "One man's spending is another's income" any consumption re-injected again as slightly less income, based on the Marginal Propensity to consume.






- Increased mining investment = Increase Autonoous Expenditure
- Inflow into the Circular flow of income, which will propogate through economy
- Propagation will be **limited** by leakages (MPS)
- Multiplier effect ($k=1 \div MPS$) < **factor it would increase by**
- Final change in income > than investment'
