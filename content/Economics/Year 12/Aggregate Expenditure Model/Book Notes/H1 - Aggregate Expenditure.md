#### Consumption Expenditure
Largest component is *consumption expenditure*. by households on g&s.

###### stuff in consumption
Consumption is 53% of total [[Aggregate Expenditure]]. consisting of Expenditure on;

Durable goods are discretionary, thus consumers can **put off spending** on during ***times of economic difficulty***.

("Chain Volume" aka constant prices are used on goods to avoid changes in prices, *inflation*, inflating that amount of products measured to be produced. **the book**, uses these always unless otherwise stated)
