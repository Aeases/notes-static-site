FThe *full aggregate expenditure model* adds in the assumptions of governemnt & overseas seactors.
$$AE = C+I_p + G + (X-M)$$
Here;
Government Expenditure, and Exports are assumed to be *autonomous*, meaning they are **independant of real GDP**.
Imports however are assumed to increase with the level of disposable income, and, like consumption, are influenced by the "[[Marginal Propensity| Marginal Propensity to Import]]". e.g. M.P.I of 0.10 means for every $100 of GDP that increases, Imports increase by $10.

On the **Full Aggregate Expenditure model**;
- The X axis is now "Real GDP" as opposed to "*Real Income*" as it was on the [[Consumption Function.excalidraw|Consumption Function Diagram]]. 
- Equilibrium income occurs where Aggregate planned expenditure equals GDP (*the brown dotted line*)

If Real GDP is below equal, total **spending** *exceeds* output. leading to inventories falling
If Real GDP is *above* equal, output *exceeds* total **spending**. leading to inventories going up.'

Inventores falling sends a signal to *hire additional resources* (people) in order to increase output. Output will rise pushing up Real GDP (a measure of output) towrads equilibrium.

#### Macro-economic Equilibrium
As depicted below at $Y_e$, equilibrium occurs when;
- Total Planned Spending equals Total Output
- At the point where the $45 \degree$ line intersects the AE function

Spending > Output = â¬‡Inventories ğŸ ±Income
Spending < Output = ğŸ ±Inventories â¬‡Income
