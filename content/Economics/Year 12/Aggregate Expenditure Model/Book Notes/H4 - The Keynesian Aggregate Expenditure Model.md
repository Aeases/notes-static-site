Economic Growth averaged *-5%* from 1929 - 1931, and unemployment in some countries exceeded 30%. This was before Keynesian Economics, when completely free capitalism was the main focus,
Non-keynesian Economics;
>- Market set prices
>- Market set wages
>- No Government Intervention
>- Believed Government spending should match revenue collected. No matter the state of the economy.

- Keynes believed *Aggregate Demand* determined *economic activity*.
- He proposed the use of [[Fiscal Policy]] and [[Monetary Policy]] to mitigate adverse effects of downturns in aggregate demand.
- Keynes ideas popularised during 1940s to 1950s. It was known as the "**Keynesian Revolution**"
- Keynes ideas make the size & impact of the Business Cycles phases smaller than prior.


## The Consumption Function
$$C=a+bY$$
Where;
$C$ = Consumption
$b$ = [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to Consume]]
Y = Income
It is a function, like in maths e.g. $f(C)=a+bY$ is the same.
When plotted;
Spending is on the vertical axis.
*Disposible Income* is on the horizontal Axis
The $45 \degree$ goes out from the bottem left to the top right, equal distance from either side. Thus showing where *Disposible Income*  is equal to *Spending*. Or where **$\text{Total Income}=\text{Planned Expenditure}$**. (Planned Expenditure is just the spending i assume).
Where consumption intersects the $45 \degree$ line, the economy is in *equilibrium*, spending in the economy is stable. **Income, Output, and spending are in *balance***. This is also called the "*breakeven*" point.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Income}=\text{Consumption}+\text{Savings} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y=C+S \\
S = Y-C
\end{aligned}
$$

- If Income is greater than equilibrium, **income** ***exceeds*** *consumption* and thus consumers save some of their income, meaning they longer "*breakeven*" in terms of savings, and savings is positive. 
	e.g. an economy where everyone earns 10 units of income, and lives off only 1 unit.
	$10_Y-1_C=9_S$, so they save the rest (9 units). This would not last long.
- If Income is below equilibrium *consumption* ***exceeds*** **income**, and thus consumers must take out money from their savings to cover their consumption, so they no longer "*breakeven*" and savings is negative  this is referred to as "Dis-savings".
	e.g. An economy where no income is 0, but everyone takes out and consumes 1 unit to survive: $(-1_S = 0_Y -1_C)$  here the equation says savings is -1 since they make no money but spend money

$a$ is *Autonomous Consumption*, it is the y-intercept where Income = 0, but consumption remains.
$b$ is the  [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to Consume]], it is the "**rate consumption changes when Income rises**", and represents the slope / gradient of the consumption function. 
in other words, $b$ is a percentage 0%-100%, that represents the *proportion of income people will spend on consumption* rather than savings. if b = 60%, for every $1, 60% will be consumed, 40% will be saved. 
- b is equal to MPC in the consumption function, 
- the opposite, MPS, [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to save]] is the portion of MPC not consumed.
$MPC+MPS = 1$

#### Introducing the Financial Sector
The *Vertical-Axis* uses "*Aggregate Expenditure*" unlike "*Total Spending*" on the consumption function, though this doesnt really change anything
This model assumes $\text{Aggregate Expenditure} = C+I$ where; I = *Investment*

The model assumes Investment is constant and ignores changes to due [[Aggregate Expenditure#Influences|Investment Influences]].
