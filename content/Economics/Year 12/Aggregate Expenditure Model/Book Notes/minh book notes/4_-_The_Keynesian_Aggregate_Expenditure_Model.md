## 4.3.1 - The consumption function of the aggregate expenditure model.
![[Pasted image 20230706111452.png]]

**The consumption function** describes the relationship between the level of disposable income received by households and the level of consumption and saving.

Figure 9.5 **assumes**:
- There is no government or overseas sector.
- Consumers can only either spend or save their income (Y = C + S).

### 4.3.1.1 - Components of Figure 9.5 (incomplete aggregate expenditure model).
The **y-axis** shows the level of household spending and the **x-axis** shows the level of disposable income (aka. real GDP).

**The 45 degree line** shows where planned expenditure equals total income which represents an economy's equilibrium state where the level of income, output, and spending is equal and balanced.

The **breakeven point** occurs at the intersection of consumer spending and the levels of disposable income (in this case, 150 billion).
- Levels of income above the breakeven point see consumption being less than income and savings is positive (>0 on the y-axis).
- Levels of income below the breakeven point see consumption exceeds income and savings is negative (dissaving, <0 on the y-axis).

### 4.3.1.2 - The consumption function line.
In Figure 9.5, **AE = C**.

**The consumption function (C)** can be expressed as a linear line: 
- C = a + bY

**Autonomous spending (a)** refers to the level of spending on essentials that must occur regardless of the levels of income.
	The level of **a** occurs at the vertical intercept.
	-
	Autonomous spending occurs even when households have no income (0), where households would draw on previous savings, receive transfer payments, or borrow.
	-
	a **=** dissaving.

**Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) (b)**  is the proportion of the **change in income** that is spent on consumption.
	Another view is the proportion of income spent minus autonomous spending.
	-
	**MPC** = Change in C / Change in Y = Rise of C / Run of C
		Can be found using equilibrium point and autonomous spending.

**Marginal propensity to save (MPS)** is the proportion of the change in income that is saved.
	**MPS** = Change in S / Change in Y = Rise of S / Run of S
		Can be found using the breakeven point and the inital dissaving point or 1 - MPC.

**MPC + MPS = 1** is a must given that Figure 9.5 assumes all income can only be either spent or saved.

MPC and MPS are **dependent on the attitude** of consumers with an increase in MPC will see the consumption function line **steepening** as per a given level of income, more is spent.

**Average propensity to consume (APC)** and **average propensity to save (APS)** is the overall proportion of income spent or saved.

As income rises:
- MPC and MPS do not change because they are **constant**, reflecting the **proportion of the change** in income that is spent or saved.

- APC and APS changes, reflecting the **proportion of the whole** income that is spent or saved.

- MPC remains constant (e.g., 0.6 of 100) means that as income increases by a constant, APC decreases because the spending is getting smaller relative to the increasing income.

## 4.3.2 - The financial sector of the aggregate expenditure model.
**The financial sector** acts as an intermediary to channel the savings of households to firms who draw on these funds to finance investment.

![[Pasted image 20230706120825.png]]

Figure 9.6 **assumes**:
- Investment spending (Ip) is a fixed amount ($60B) independent of income.

Figure 9.6 **relaxes the assumption** that income can only either be spent or saved.

In Figure 9.6, **AE = C + I**.

The **level of investment** is shown by the horizontal line (I) at a fixed amount of $60B.

**Total planned spending (C+I)** = The amount of investment (I) + the amount of consumption at each level of income (C).

**Equilibrium** occurs where total planned spending equals the level of income / output or where planned saving equals planned investment by firms.
	Occurs at the intersection of C+I and the 45 degree line or at S and I.
	-
	At equilibrium, economic forces are balanced and there is no tendency for change.
	-
	**Inventories (unplanned investment)** drives the economy towards equilibrium.
		The level of savings is greater than the level of planned investment -> Inventories rises -> Firms reduce production -> Reduce employment and income -> Reduce consumption.
		-
		The level of savings is less than investment -> Inventories falls -> Firms increase production -> Increase employment and income -> Increase consumption.

## 4.3.3 - The full aggregate expenditure model.
![[Pasted image 20230706131959.png]]

Figure 9.7 **relaxes the assumption** that there are no government or overseas sector.

The **y-axis** is now aggregate expenditure and the **x-axis** is now real GDP.

**AE** = C + Ip + G + (X - M)

The aggregate expenditure model **assumes** that:
- **I, G, and X** are autonomous, independent of real income or real GDP, and constant.
- M is a function of income.
- C is a function of income.

The **marginal propensity to import (MPM)** is the proportion of income that is spent on import.

### 4.3.3.1 - The concept of equilibrium in aggregate expenditure.
![[Pasted image 20230706133848.png]]

**Macroeconomic equilibrium** occurs when total planned spending equals production / income.
	When the AE function intersects the 45 degree line.

If real GDP is **below** the equilibrium:
- Total spending exceeds output -> Decrease inventories -> Firms respond by hiring additional resources (Increase income) -> Increases output until equilibrium is reached.

If real GDP is **above** the equilibrium:
- Total spending is below output -> Increases inventories -> Firms reduces production (Decrease income) -> Decreases output until equilibrium is reached.

At **equilibirum**, there are no unplanned changes to inventories which means there are no tendency for output or income to change.
