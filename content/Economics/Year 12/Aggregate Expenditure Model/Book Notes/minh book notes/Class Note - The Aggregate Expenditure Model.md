# The consumption function.
Aggregate expenditure = C + I + G + (X-M)

Consumption expenditure is the most important component of aggregate expenditure according to Keynes.

Consumption expenditure accounts for around **55%** of Australia's aggregate spending.

Factors affecting consumption expenditure (**SPICE**):
- Stock of wealth.
- Policies of government.
- Income.
- Cost of credit.
- Expectations.

Yd = Disposable income.

C = Consumption expenditure.

S = Savings.

As income is 0, an economy will have to borrow money from another economy, making S the same amount as C, but negative reflecting debt.

**Consumption function (Cf)** = Autonomous spending (a) + Marginal propensity to consume (b) x Disposable income (Yd) 

**Autonomous spending** occurs no matter the amount of income as they are essential to survival (in the table above, its 60).

**Marignal propensity to consume** is the proportion of disposable income consumers are likely to spend.

Disposable income is income after tax.

Changing labels:
- Instead of consumer spending and saving, use **aggregate expenditure**.
- Instead of disposable income, use **real GDP** or real GNI (Gross national income).

The gap between the x-axis and **a and -a should be the same**, reflecting the mirror of spending and savings when disposable income (real GDP / real GNI) is 0.
