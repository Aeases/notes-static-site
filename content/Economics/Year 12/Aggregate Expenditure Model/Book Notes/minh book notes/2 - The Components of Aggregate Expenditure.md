	- Consumption.
	- Investment.
	- Government spending.
	- Net exports.

# 2.2 - Summary.
# 2.3 - Content.
## 2.3.1 - The concept of aggregate expenditure.
**Aggregate expenditure** (AE) is the sum of all expenditure on final goods and services undertaken in the economy during a specific time period.

- **AE = C + I + G + (X - M)**
	- Consumption (C).
	- Investment (I).
	- Government spending (G).
	- Net exports (X - M).

- In **2021 - 2022**, Australia's **GDP** was approx. $2,091 billion.
	- **GDP = output = AE = income.**
	- Consumption = 53% (2021 - 2022).
	- Investment = 18% (2021 - 2022).
	- Government expenditure = 27% (2021 - 2022).
	- Net exports = 2% (2021 - 2022).

### 2.3.1.1 - Consumption (C) as a component of AE.
**Consumption** is household expenditure on final goods (non-durables and durables) and services.

**Generally**, consumption accounts for **49% - 60%** of AE, and **averaged ~56%** of AE between 1980 - 2022.

In **2021 - 2022,** **consumption expenditure (C)** accounted for **53%** of GDP ($1,103 billion).

Consumption expenditure (C) **consists** of:
- Expenditure on non-durable goods.
- Expenditure on durable goods.
- Expenditure on services.

**Goods** are tangible products whereas **services** are intangible actions with both providing value to consumers, firms, and the government.
	Goods e.g., a car.
	Services e.g., education.

**Non-durable goods** are consumed shortly after purchase (up to 3 years) and are usually **essential** which make non-durable consumption spending **stable** over time accounting for **~ 35%** of C in AE.
	- Non-durable goods e.g., food.
	- Essential is when the good satisfies regular needs of households.

**Durable goods** lasts for more than three years and is often **discretionary**, accounting for **~15%** of C in AE.
	- Durable goods **include**:
		- White goods (large items e.g., washing machine).
		- Brown goods (light household items e.g., TV)
		- Furniture, sporting equipment, motor vehicles, etc.
	- Discretionary spending can be postponed and is not essential.

**Services** can be essential (e.g., health) or discretionary (e.g., cinema) and accounts for **~50%** of C in AE.

### 2.3.1.2 - Investment (I) as a component of AE.
I in AE refers to **private sector investment (I)** which is the spending on new capital goods and additions to investories (stock).

**Generally**, private investment (I) accounts for **16% - 23%** of AE (1980 -2022) and **averaged 20%**.

In **2021 - 2022**, I accounts for **18%** of AE.

Investment spending **(I) includes**:
- **Business investment** - privately funded business spending on capital goods used in production (e.g., equipment, machinery, and buildings).
- **Housing investment** - Private expenditure on new housing.
- **Inventories** - Unsold goods or stock.

Investment spending is **volatile** with its fluctuations being the key factor in changes of **the business cycle**.

### 2.3.1.3 - Government expenditure (G) as a component of AE.
**Government spending (G)** includes current spending (G1) and capital spending (G2).
	- **Current spending** finances day-to-day business of the government e.g., wages and purchase of G&S.
	- **Capital spending** is spending on public infrastructure e.g., power and water supply and schools.

**Generally**, government spending (G) accounts for **24%** of AE (1980 - 2022).

In **2021 - 2022**, government spending (G) accounted for 27% of AE ($580 billion).

### 2.3.1.4 - Net exports (X - M) as a component of AE.
**Net exports** refers to the difference between exports and imports.
	- **Exports** occur when overseas residents purchase Australian G&S, and is an injection in the circular flow of income.
	- **Imports** occur when Australian residents purchase overseas G&S, and is a withdrawal from the circular flow of income.
	- **Residents** include households, firms, and government.

**Generally**, net exports account for **-1%** of AE (1980 - 2022).

In **2021 - 2022**, net exports experienced a surplus and accounted for 2% of AE.

### 2.3.1.3 - Trend of the components of AE (1980 - 2022).

**Consumption** in AE has been falling since 2016 which was exaberated by COVID-19:
- Increase household savings.

**Net exports**, normally a negative in Australia, has been positive the last few years up to 6% of GDP:
- **Outbound tourism** (normally Australia's largest import) was affected by COVID-19.
- **Decrease in consumption and investment spending** decreased demand for imports.

**Private investment** has been falling since 2016 and was exaberated by COVID-19.

**Government spending** rose since 2016 (peaks in 2020) reflecting increased need for welfare payments.
