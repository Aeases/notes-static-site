>>[!bug]- pretty sure this old definition is wrong
>>Includes the autonomous expenditure in propensity to consume, this means that it falls as income rises since the autononomous component does not increase with the income.

Ceteris Paribus, assuming constant, non-changing MPC and MPS:
As Income rises, average propensity to *consume* **falls**.
As Income rises, average propensity to *save* **increases**.

>double check if $C$ below is normal C or different C w/ autonomosus expenditre

## Consume
$$APC = \frac{C}{Y_d}$$

## Save (maybe)
$$APS=\frac{S}{Y_d}$$
double check $APS$.
