Goal
Price Stability occurs when there is low inflation, (2-3%) , this helps **avoid**:
- the reduction of household expectations, and purchasing power  (can reduce [[Aggregate Expenditure#Consumption (**C**) 55-60%|AE - Consumption]]), which is against fundamentals of [[H4 - The Keynesian Aggregate Expenditure Model|Keynesian Model]].
- Avoid the need for [[Interest Rate]] increases by RBA. Increase in I.R causes a [[H2 - Determinants - Influences of Aggregate Expenditure#Why is there an inverse relationship between Investment and Interest Rates?|Reduction of Aggregate Expenditure]] according to Keynesian model)
- Inflation feeds into lowering business *expectations*, [[H2 - Determinants - Influences of Aggregate Expenditure#Expectations Influences on "Elasticity of Investment"|decreasing business expectations]] thereby reducing long-term capital investment, encouraging non-productive investment.
- Helps avoid **non-productive** *speculative investment* in things like property and antiques that arise from people trying to find hedges against price increases.
- Inflation causes *structural change*, e.g. capital-for-labour substituition when wages rise faster than productivity, "pricing themselvs out of the job".
- Avoids the burden of inflation, whic primarily impacts low income earners.

Price Stability in-turn helps encourage;
- Consistent household expectations & purchasing power
- A low interest rate that reduces the [[H2 - Determinants - Influences of Aggregate Expenditure#The reality of the relationship between interest rates & investment|Opportunity cost of consumption]].
- Maintain [[International Competiveness]] in the international market, Instable prices (high inflation) higher than those overseas erode competitiveness.
