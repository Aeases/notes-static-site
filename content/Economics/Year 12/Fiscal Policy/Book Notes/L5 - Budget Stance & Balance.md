- ### Structural Balance
	Formed by the government's deliberate decisions regarding; 
	- spending and;
	- Taxation
- *Determines the Budget Stance*
- Ideally would equal 0 at potential GDP ([[Full Employment]])
- ### Cyclical Balance
Formed by the actual effect of [[L4 - Stabilising the Econonomy#Automatic Stabilisers|Automatic Stabilisers]] 


#### The Balance & The Stance
The stance of Fiscal Policy is determined by the **Structural Balance**. We are only in an expansionary Stance if the Structural Balance is in deficit, and only in a contractionary stance if it is in Surplus. 
The Cyclical Component does not tell us this.

- We can not seperate the parts of the budget that are Cyclical & those that are Discretionary with full accuracy
	- The Government provides estimates however.
