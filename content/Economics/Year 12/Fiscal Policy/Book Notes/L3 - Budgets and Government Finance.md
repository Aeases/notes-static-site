When there is a **Budget Deficit**, the government must **borrow** to finance the difference. 

Conversely, when there is a **Budget Surplus**, they **save** and pay off past debt.

### Budget Deficits have an **Expansionary** Effect?
A Budget Deficit causes a **Net Injection** of funds into the economy, if the Planned Govenrment Spending was $500b, and the planned revenue was $450b, then the planned net injection resulting from the difference is worth $50 billion. That's $50b injected.
Even if the Budget Deficit Falls from one year to the next, the effect is still expansionary, for example;
- Year 1 - Deficit of $20b, $k=2.5$
	- Real GDP will increase by \$50b since mutliplier ($20 \times 2.5$)
- Year 2 - Deficit of $10b, $k = 2.5$
	- Real GDP will **also increase** by ($10 \times 2.5=25$) $25b

## Methods to Finance a Deficit (Boarba)
- Selling new Government **B**onds
- "Borrowing" from the ***[[Reserve Bank of Australia|RBA]]*** (Central Bank)
- Borrowing from **O**verseas ([[Foreign Debt]])
- Selling Government **A**ssets



### Commonwealth Government Securities / **Bonds**
Commonwealth Government Securities, (CGS) / **Bonds**, can be sold by the government to finance a deficit.
CGS / **Bonds** are responsible for 95% of the government's borrowing requirement. 
- Bonds raise funds for their **issuer**, in return for a rate of interest to the buyer.
- Bonds are guarranteed by the government, and thus, are very popular with instituitonal and private investment
- Bonds are purchasable by both **Domestic** and **Foreign**, [[Residents]].
	- Foreign Residents purchasing bonds ***is*** ~~not~~ "Borrowing from overseas"
- 45% of Bonds are owned by foreign businesses
- In 2022, **$892b** worth of CGS is issued by the government.

##### Advantages
- Selling bonds to domestic residents **does not affect the money supply** in the long-run.
	- This is because a leakage occurs at the time of borrowing, but then it is reinjcted into the econonomy since government only borrows when it has a deficit.
	- So in the long-run, once the government spends the borrowed funds the effect [[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=3&selection=1626,0,1632,7|effect on the money supply is nil]].
##### Disadvantages
- When the government issues bonds it **competes** in the **Financial Market**, leading to [[L6 - Strengths & Weaknesses of Fiscal Policy#Crowding out|Crowding Out]] out of Private Investment as their outcompeted by bonds that are comparatively cheaper.
	

### Printing Money (The RBA)
- The government can borrow from the RBA
- "Printing money" from the RBA **directly increases the *money supply***. 
##### Advantages
- Will have the desired "Expansioanry effect" on the ecnonomy
##### Disadvantages
- Increases inflationary pressure.
---
The RBA is also **independant**, and thus can, if it decides that it would od harrm, not fund the government's deficit.
	- #econs-example The RBA has said that they will not fund the current government's deficit.

### Borrowing from Overseas
>[!abstract] Foreign Residents can buy bonds too.
>Foreigners buying bonds is the same thing as "Borrowing from Overseas"

##### Advantages
- This is when the govenrment takes on [[Foreign Debt]], directly borrowing from foreign banks.
- This would result in a direct **inflow** of money capital.
- Does **not** result in [[L6 - Strengths & Weaknesses of Fiscal Policy#Crowding out|Crowding Out]]. 
- Generate Income remittances in the [[Balance of Payments]] ---> Ongoing det repayments for future generations pushing the [[Burden of Borrowing]] onto future generations as they must repay this debt.
##### Disadvantages
-  causing an appreciation in the [[Exchange Rate]].
- Adds to [[Foreign Debt]] / "**public** debt"
	- This causes greater leakages than injections in the long-run though as we have to pay it back through [[Income Remittance]]s which could have a signficiant [[Opportunity Cost]].
### Sell Public Assets
- Government can "privatise" some of their assets, likke government business enterprises, or government propery, land, and/or buildings.
- This is **not used often** because it can compromise the level of public services.

## Government Debt
- in 2022-23 the government net debt was **$572b**.
- The annual interest payments equals **$13.6b**.
If governments use this borrowing to **grow** the economy, through higher levels of economic activity, and increased spending on infrastructure, then it is beneficial to take on debt to finance these things in the long run.

# Impact of a Surplus
###### What the government can do with a surplus
- The government can pay off government debt built up by past deficits
- The money can be kept to pay for deficits in the future.
- Returned to taxpaers, e.g. as a direct payment, or tax cut

>[!example] #econs-example 
>Australia had **zero** public debt in the mid-2000s, thus they;
>- Returned some to tax payers
>- Keeped some for future deficits
