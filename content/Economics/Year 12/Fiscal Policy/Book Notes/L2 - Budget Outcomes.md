### The Budget Outcome
Refers to the relationship between **Government Revenue** (T) and **Government Spending** (G).

- #### Balanced Budget (G=T)
- #### Surplus Budget (T > G)
- #### Deficit Budget (G > T)

### When does the budget outcome occur?
[[Chapter 12 - Fiscal Policy.pdf#page=2&selection=989,1,1046,5|Source]]
- **Surplus Budgets**, (T > G), or revenue is greater than spending, occurs when;
	- GDP growth is strong
	- Economy is close to [[Full Employment]]

- **Deficit Budgets**, (G > T), aka, spending is greater than revenue, occurs when;
	- GDP growth is slow, or;
	- Economy has contracted


##### Planned Budget is not the Actual budget
The actual budget will *always* be different.

Various external unexpected factors can drastically or slightly change the actual budget outcome from the planned one, e.g.;
- Tax income being slightly lower causes more of a deficit
- An Untacipated upswing could result in a rising government revenues and lower welfare spending.
- #### Exogenous Factors (Economic Shocks)
	- Ukraine War
	- COVID-19 Pandemic
