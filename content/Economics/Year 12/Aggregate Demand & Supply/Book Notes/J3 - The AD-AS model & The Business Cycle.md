The [[Aggregate Demand & Supply|AD-AS Model]] is useful for visuallising;
- Visuallising **expansions** & **contractions** of the [[The Business Cycle|business cycle]];
- Visuallising problems assosciated with the B.C, mianly [[Unemployment]], and [[Inflation]].

##### Visuallising Business Cycle Contractions
###### Negative AD Shock
![[Pasted image 20230810200236.png]]
- Assume the economy is in [[J2 - Macroeconomic Equilibrium#**Long-run** Equilibrium|long-run Equilibrium]] 
  ($AD_1$, $SRAS$ Intersect at $Y_p$)
- A reduction of Aggregate Demand down to $AD_2$ occurs.
  This would cause firms to cut prouduction, *causing income and employment to fall*, thus, Real Output would fall from $Y_p$ >> $Y_1$. 
- The economy is further away from capacity, thus, there is reduced Inflationary pressure so the price level fall from $P_1$ to $P_2$. 
###### Negative AS Shock
![[Pasted image 20230810201213.png]]
This economy starts at long-run equilibrium, then experiences a Aggregate Supply Shock.
- We begin at Long-run Equilibrium
- The AS Shock occurs;
  ðŸ ±Production Costs >> ðŸ ±Upwards Pressure on price ([[Stagflation]])
- Prices rise from $P_1$ to $P_2$ due to Upwards pressure.
- Similar to the [[#Negative AD Shock, Visualised|AD Shock]], Output drops from $Y_p$ to $Y_1$.

>[!important] Difference between negative AS / AD Shock
>Aggregate Demand Shock causes decreases in price & decrease in output
>Aggregate Supply Shock causes increase in price & decrease in output

##### Visualising Expansions
###### Positive AD Expansion
![[Expansionary Visual AD Increase.excalidraw]]
In Australia's recent mining construction boom;
- ðŸ ± Investment Spending, & Strong commodity exports
  AD Curve shifts from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ due to ðŸ ±Inv. & Strong comodity exports.
  - AD=(C+**ðŸ ±I**+G+(**ðŸ ±X**-M))
- ðŸ ±AD >> ðŸ ±Employment, and ðŸ ±Income, and ðŸ ±Production/**Output** (Real GDP) shifting from $Y_p$ to $Y_1$
	(Econ. Growth = **4.4%**), **10%** in WA / Queensland
	â¬‡Unemployment to 4% (below that times natural level)
- Likely pressure on price level as the econonomy approaches capacitiy, causing shift from $P_1$ to $P_2$.
###### Positive AS Expansion
![[Expansionary Visual AS Increase.excalidraw]]
An Expansion caused by the AS curve shifting right will cause inflation to fall.
This would be because we will have increased output without increasing price levels.
