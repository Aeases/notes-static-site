#### Limitations of the Aggregate Expenditure Model
- AE Model focuses on the **impact** of a **change in spending on output**. (says nothing about impact of changing expenditure on ge neral prices, therefore *does not* say anything about *inflation*)
- Therefore **ignores *supply side* of the economy**
- AE Model only focuses on demand side of economy.
	- Changes in labour force, Capital Stock, Level of Technology, Rising productivity not considered in AE Model

The Aggregate Demand / Supply model is a more "complete model"

### Aggregate Demand
AD is the *total amount of demand* for final goods & services (**GDP**) at **any point in time**.
- *AD* is similar *in definition* to **AE**
- AD different when presented as a model

Aggregate Demand shows a **negative relationship** between *demand* and the *price level*.
- X Axis shows *level of output*. Labelled Real GDP.
- Y-Axis shows *Price Level*. 

![[Excali-Aggregate-Demand-Diagram.excalidraw]]
##### Why is there a negative relationship between AD & Price Level
- The [[Wealth Effect|Income / Wealth Effect]] 
	As ⬆ **Price Level / Inflation** *leads to >* ⬇Household "Wealth" (purchasing power) *leads to >* ⬇**Houeshold Consumption** (⬇$AE_C$) 
- The [[Interest Rate Effect]]
	As ⬆ **Price Level / Inflation** *leads to >* ⬆ Interest Rates *leads to >* ⬇ Investment & ⬇ Consumption (**⬇$AE_C$** AND **⬇$AE_I$**)
- The [[Open Economy Effect]]
	As ⬆ **Price Level / Inflation** *leads to >* ⬆ [[Relative Inflation Rates]] *leads to >* ⬇International Competitiveness & ⬆ Imports *causes* ⬇[[H2 - Determinants - Influences of Aggregate Expenditure#Factors Influencing Net Exports|Net Exports]] 

Simply;
if⬆Price Levels (which is ⬆Inflation) expect **total spending** in the economy to fall.

Which would cause a movement up & left along the AD curve as shown below. ⬇ Price Levels likely cause a movement to the *right*

###### Shifts of the entire AD curve
If any factor *other than price levels* change demand, the whole curve will shift.
This could be anything that influences any of the components of [[Aggregate Expenditure]].
>[!example] #econs-example
> If the government reduced income tax, ⬆ Disposible income > ⬆ Household spending. This non price level factor would shift the *aggregate demand curve* **right**. (an increase in AD)
Other non-price factor examples that would shift it to the **right** include;
>- **⬆**Consumer Confidence 
>- *⬇* Interest Rates
>- **⬆** Household wealth from ⬆ Property Values
>- **⬆** Government Spending
>- **High** Economic Growth in China > ⬆ Aus. Exports
Increases in AD represent **⬆ Real GDP**, **⬆Income**, and **⬆Employment**

It might shift to the *left* for;
- ⬇Business Confidence > ⬇Investment Spending
- ⬆ Interest Rates > Investment Spending
- ⬇Government Spending
### Aggregate Supply
The *aggregate supply curve* is actually 2 curves.
![[Pasted image 20230722161604.png|400]]

#### Long-run Aggregate Supply Curve (LRAS)

The LRAS curve is *vertical*, because;

it represents the maximum *potential* **level of output** at a particular point in time. (not influenced by price level, therefore it is vertical, since x-axis is price level)

##### Shifts in the Vertical Position of the LRAS Curve
LRAS Curve ***vertical position*** is determined by;
- **Population size**
- **Labour Influence from Capital**
- **Work Force Participation**

Labour Influence is how much the *productivity* of labour can be enhanced / "*influenced*" by the stock of capital equipment and the ***current state of technology***.
#### Short-run Aggregate Supply Curve (SRAS)
- The SRAS curve describes the relationship between **total production** and the **price level**. They are ***positively*** related. meaning they are "positively sloped".

This means As economic activity increases, price level rises. This occurs due to the following factors;
Firms Increasing production require: ***Labour*** resources & ***Capital*** resources
This demand puts *upwards pressure* on **⬆resource prices**, (wages mainly)
This effect is exastrabated as the economy approaches it's "potential capacity" aka [[Full Employment]].
![[SRAS-Agg.Supply-diagram.excalidraw]]
Wages increases as a result of increased output is especially evident nearing [[Full Employment]] as labour becomes more scarce. and therefore costs more.

##### Shifts in the **SRAS** Supply Curve
The SRAS curve is shifted by events that affect the *availability of resources* or short-term *costs of production*, e.g;
Shift **left**wards - Total Production *decreased* independant of price levels
- Early Stage COVID [[Supply Shock]].
	Due to Strict lockdowns in China causing disruption to world supply chains
- Increase in Minimimum wage recently
	Will cause an increase in the costs of production. ( #ask_davis will this cause shift or movement???)

Shifts **right**wards - Total Production *increased* independant of price levels
- Technological Improvement
- Fall in price of important input
	e.g. Oil is an important input in production, a ⬇in oil prices would mean ⬆ GDP & Employment
