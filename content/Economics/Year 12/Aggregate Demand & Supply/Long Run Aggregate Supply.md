The long run is a amount of time where firms have the ability to adjust their activities to maximise costs of production. This is shown on the LRAS model.

###### Influences Shifts in the LRAS Curve (TERP)
- Improvements in Technology
- Increases in Efficiency
- Increaases in Resources
- Immigration (Population)

Shifts in the LRAS curve allow us to move our **long-run equilibrium**.
![[TERP.excalidraw]]

The actual equilibrium can go above potential **LRAS** equilibrium, chances are we are operating at about 3-3.5%, we should be above our growth target here. **This can only exist in the short-term unless full employment rises.**.

#### Describing Long-run Equilibrium in essay

>[!example] Example - Consumer Confidence falls from a economy in long-run equilibrium. (**AD Decrease**)
>Due to a lack of consumer confidence in the economy the AD curve will shift to the left ($AD_1$ >> $AD_2$). The economy which intiially was in long run equilibrium, will see a declien in the gernal level of rices ($I_1$ >> $I_2$) and there will be a fall in the level of GDP and GNI from ($Y_1$ >> $Y_2$) The economy now has a contractioonary gap.

>> 3. General Level of prices decreeases ([[Stagflation]] maybe?)
>> 4. Govt economic Policy

>[!example] Example - Housing Prices increase at Long-run equilibrium (**AD Increase**)
>Due to an increase in housing prices in the Australian real estate market, consumer stock of wealth has risen shifting the AD curve ($AD_1$ >> $AD_2$). As a result the genereral level of prices in the Australian economy will rise ($I_1$, >> $I_2$) as will the level of real *GDP*, & *GNI*, ($Y_p$ >> $Y_1$). The Economy is expericencing an expansionary gap.

>[!bug]- kinda irrelavent 
Shift of SRAS left in long-ru nequilibrium will cause an increase in unemployment but not as much as a shift in the AD curve to the left
