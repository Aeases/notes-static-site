### Short-run Equilibrium (SRAS & AD)
When [[Aggregate Supply#Short-run|SRAS]] Curve meets [[Aggregate Demand]], there is equilibrium
Thus;
- Changes in AD curve causes a shift in equilibrium
	Influenced by changes in *costs of production* or changs in *availability of resources*
- Changes in SRAS curve causes a shift in equilibrium
	Influenced by changes in Components of [[Aggregate Expenditure]], e.g. [[DIGSE - Influences on Consumption|SPICE]], or [[GRIPE - Investment Influences|GRIPE]], etc.

>[!example] How to describe in an essay.
>As a result of *strong growth in China* there has been an increase in *demand for Australian commodity exports* this leads to *an increase in aggregate demand* ($AD_1$ >> $AD_2$), 
>- **Identify** the Scenario
>- **Explain** the change in AE
>- **How** does that shift the curve
>- **How** does that impact *levels of prices* & *levels of output*
>Due to the increased demand in the economy, there has been an increase in the gneeral level of prices ($I_1$ >> $I_2$), and also an increase in the level of real gdp, and also real gross national income, (from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$)

>[!question]- Practise - a decrease in the world cost of oil
>As a result of *a decrease in world oil prices* there has been a *increase in costs of production* for domestic producers, becuase oil is an extremely common productive input. This leads to a shift in the *SRAS* Curve to the right. ($SRAS_1$ to $SRAS_2$) as a result of the reduced cost of production, there has been an *decrease* in the general level of prices ($I_1$ >> $I_2$)

>[!question]- A increase in the labour force
>An increase in the labour force leads to increased availability of labour resources, (likely also a decrease in c.o.p as labour gets cheaper) this leads to a shift to the right in the SRAS curve. ($SRAS_1$ >> $SRAS_2$). Due to the increased Supply, the general level of prices decreases ($I_1$ >> $I_2$) and GDP rises from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$.

>[!question]- A worsening of australias terms of trade
>As a result of the *worsening of Australia's [[Terms of Trade]],* we see an imediate impact on [[Influences on Net Exports|Net Exports]], a *component of Aggregate Demand*. Thus, the *demand curve shifts to the left* ($AD_1$ >> $AD_2$), Due to the decreased demand in the economy, there is a decrease in the general level of prices (inflation) ($I_1$ >> $I_2$), and also an decrease in the level of real gdp (from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$)

>[!question]- Increase in Mining Investment
>As a result of an increase in Mining Investment, we see an immediate increase in one of the components of Aggregate Expenditure ([[Aggregate Expenditure#Investments (**I**) - 16-23%|Investment]]), Therefore, there is a shift in the aggredate demand curve to the right. ($AD_1$ >> $AD_2$), Due to the increased demand, there is an increase in the general level of prices, ($I_1$ >> $I_2$) and a increase in the real GDP ($Y_1$ >> $Y_2$).

![[Simultaneous Shift.excalidraw]]
If there is a simultaeous shift in both the AD & SRAS curves, we can not tell whether the price has *increased* or *decreased*, since an shift in the AD curve to the right **increases prices**, where as a shift to the right in the SRAS curve **decreases price**, without proper values for each, ***the price change is indeterminate***.
# Chapter Concepts:
- The aggregate demand (AD) curve and factors that can cause movements along and shifts of the AD curve
- The aggregate supply (AS) curve and factors that can cause movements along and shifts of the AS scurve
- Macroeconomic Equilibrium using the AD/AS model
- The impact of changes in aggregate demand and aggregate supply on the equilibrium evel of income / output
- The use of the AD/AS model to explain the business Cycle
