	[[Interest Rate]]s represent;
- the **price of credit**. 
- rate of **return for saving surplus** funds
	- aka. The opportunity cost of money.
		- The opportunity cost of money meaning **money that could've been deposited into an interest-bearing account** rather than spent elsewhere.

Interest Rate in a particular market is the ***price that equates the*** **supply and demand of funds**.
Borrowsers determine **demand** for funds
Savers determine the **supply** for funds. 
Changes in Interest Rates have a signficiant effect on the lvel of spending & economic rates since a large proportion of transactions rely on credit & borrowing.

[[Interest Rate#Real Interest Rate|Real Interest Rates]] are an important influencer on decisions involving borrowing & saving.
$$\text{Real Interest Rate}= \text{Nominal Interest Rate}-\text{Inflation Rate}$$
Real Interest rates measure how much borrowers actually pay, and how much lenders receive. Thus;
- ***Borrowers*** prefer a lower **real** interest rate.
- ***Lenders*** / ***savers*** prefer a high **real** interest rate.

- A *positive margin* exists between Interest Rates & Inflation to ensure a positive return for lenders.
	- This margin is maintained by raising Interest Rates when Inflation rises, ensuring there is always a **pool of borrowable funds***.

As seen below, interest rates vary across different types of loans;

Because Lenders need to be **compensated for different levels of risk** they take on when lending funds.

Risk is influenced over time by;
- Time over which the loan is taken
	- Longer = More Risk
- Whether the loan is secured against an asset
	- e.g. Property / other collateral
- Credit record of the borrower
