The Transmission mechanism tells us;
- ***How changes in [[Interest Rate]]s affect the level of economic activity.**
	- All different [[Interest Rate#Types of Interest Rates|types of interest rates]] change and vary on their own.
		- Thus, there is a [[Time Lags#Effect Lag|Effect Lag]] after changes in cash rate targets.

#### The Transmission Channels
As Illustrated below, these changes in the [[Interest Rate]] flow through to [[Aggregate Demand]] due to the way they influence;
- [[Aggregate Expenditure#Consumption (**C**) 55-60%|Consumption]] & [[Investment]] Through;
	- ***[[Cost of Borrowing]]***
	- ***[[Cash Flow]]***
	- ***[[Asset Prices]]***

- [[Aggregate Expenditure#Net Exports **(X-M)** -0.3% --- 6%|Net Exports]] Through;
	- ***[[Exchange Rate]]s***

These then go on to influence Real [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], [[Unemployment|Employment]], and [[Inflation]].

![[The Transmission Mechanism Diagram.excalidraw|100%]]

>[!warning] Don't draw the Transmission Mechanism Diagram

The Transmission Mechanism's Channels;
- Explain how a change in the [[Cash Rate]] bring about changes in [[Aggregate Demand]], and thus;
	- [[Gross Domestic Product|Output]], [[Unemployment|Employment]], and [[Price Stability|Prices]]
- Are how Monetary Policy does what it says in the description;
	- ![[Monetary Policy#^Monetary-Policy-Definition|clean]]

>[!note]- FYI
Ceteris Paribus, a reduction in the [[Cash Rate]] would also see;
>- a reduction in other [[Interest Rate#Types of Interest Rates|interest rates]];
>- Increase in [[Aggregate Demand]] *over time*
>	- As a result of;
>		- Reduction in incentive to save
>		- Increasing Household & Business Cash Flows
>		- Increasing Prices of Alternative Asset Classes
>			- (such as shares
>		- Downwards pressure on the [[Exchange Rate]]
>			- Increasing [[International Competiveness]]




### **Cash Flow** of households and firms.
Households can either be
- Net Savers;
	- **Advantaged**; They benefit from higher interest payments
- Net Borrowers;
	- **Disadvantaged**; They will have to make larger interest payments

Generally Firms are **Net Borrowers**, meaning that they are disadvantaged by higher Interest Rates. As rates increase, there is less free cash to;
- Pay expenses
- Expand Production
- Employ more labour;

**The ownership of** ***financial assets*** such as shares, and property seem less attractive since the relative returns of those assets decline.

### ***Asset Prices*** / Declining Growth of Asset Prices leads to;

**Contractionary Monetary Policy is the example used here that would decline asset prices**.

- Decline in "On-paper" wealth of households who have property holdings and/or share portfolios.
- Leading to perception of falling wealth
- Leading to decreases in **Household Spending**. 
	- [[Wealth Effect]]
- Which could lead to a Reduction in the Equity households offer when getting a loan.

### Exchange Rate
Changes in the Interest Rate are reflected almost immediatly reflected in the Exchange Rate due to;
- The [[Interest Rate Differential]]
	- Where foreigners invest money into countries with a higher iInterest Rate.
- The Mobilility of financial capital
	- e.g. A foreign bank can invest in australia without shipping anything, it can occur straight-away

If Australian Interest rates are above that of other countries, the I.R Differential kicks in, leading to a;
- An Increase in the [[Exchange Rate]]
- Increases in [[Capital Inflow]]
- Increase in Demand for the country

Overall, Increases in the Exchange rate put **Downwards Pressure** on Aggregate Demand as;
- Appreciation (Increase in the E.R) leads to a decrease in [[International Competiveness]]. 
	- Decreasing **net exports**
- Imports become **cheaper** for Australian households
	- Decreasing **Net Exports**
- Import-competing firms in Australia have to compete with cheaper imports.
- 
![[Figure 13.6 - Contractionary Monetary Policy.excalidraw]]

Tighter monetary policy;
- reduces upwards pressure on prices, 
- Reduces [[Aggregate Demand]]
- and Thus, ***Output*** & ***Employment***


#### The Cash Rate
- The Cash Rate is the Interest Rate on unsecured overnight loans between banks
	- Near Risk-free
- All other [[Interest Rate#Types of Interest Rates|types of Interest Rates]] are higher than the cash rate in order to compensate lenders.
- A **Time premium** that compensates **the bank** for lending over longer periods. 
	- e.g. a 25 year house mortgage.
	- #ask_davis  what does this mean, the RBA giving them a better rate for borrowing longer?
- Changes in the cash rate usually flow through to other rates as **Financial Instituitions** (not sure what ones, just ADIs? others? #ask_davis ) adjust the risk / reward profiles of their portfolio.

### How Changes in Interest Rates flow to the economy at large
Changes in the Cash Rate usually flow through to other [[Interest Rate#Types of Interest Rates|Interests rates]] as **Financial Instituitions** adjust the risk/reward profiles of their portfolio

#### Expansionary Monetary Policy

- Inflation is below the Traget range ( < 3%)
- The economy is not growing fast enough ([[Economic Growth|Econ. Growth]], (> 3.5% - 4%)
- [[Unemployment]] is below the natural rate ( < 4%)

All other interest rates are lower than the cash rate;
This is to **compensate lenders** for the risk they have to take on.


A Change in the Interest flows through to [[Aggregate Demand]] through the following influences;
- Incentives for decisions to save, borrow or invest;
- [[Cash Flow]] of households and firms
- Asset prices and perceived wealth
- The [[Exchange Rate
