##### Exam
- Important to focus on Section 3
- Section 3 has the lowest mean out of all sections in the exam
- Questions are actually straightforward
- Mainly focused on information retrieval
- **Most Common/key Verbs**
	- Explain
		- You start off with defining, and then explain, Do not just list things, in a question that has "explain"  as the commanding word, e.g;
			- explain 3 factors of current account balance dont just list them, thats minimum marks
	- Describe
		- Define then add some characteristics
You must always define the concept that you use, prior to anything else. e.g. What is the **Current Account**

- In a Describe, you must explain, dicuss, define etc.
	- Pop in some examples too

- ***in unit 3***, you must revise the [[Demand and Supply Model]], you likely cant use an AD/AS or AE model etc. #seminar-icons
	- Revise the labelling on this old models
- On axis for [[Exchange Rate Supply Demand Model]];
	- Explicitly state **price of** Australian Dollers, 
	- **quantity of** australian dollers 
etc. not just $AUD and "Quantity", otherwise they mark u down
# Unit 3
They can not ask all 7, there is a **maximum of 4** in the exam.
The most **important**
- [[Free Trade and Protection]]
- [[Balance of Payments]]
- [[Exchange Rate]]
>These ones are pretty much always on the exam.

- practically 100% getting **[[Balance of Payments]]** on the exam since it wasnt there last year
	- **study for a question on the [[Current Account]]**
- There might be [[Global Interdependance]] in the exam cus its going out of syllabus next year
- the "Gains from trade" is a popular question, this concerns the [[Terms of Trade]]. 
	- This was done poorly last time.
### Global Trade
- The largest category of merchandise trade in the world is **manufactures**
- The biggest difference in trade is 36% to 56% from 1991 to 2021
	- lead to world incomes rising, global incomes rising etc.
- **know 3 factors driving [[Globalisation]]**
	- Pushing [[Trade Liberalisation]]
	- Spread of [[Multinational Corporations]]
	- Improvement in transport & communication
- Know the definition of International Competitiveness, and influences
	- Changes in [[Exchange Rate]]
	- Changes in [[Productivity]]
	- Changes in [[Relative Inflation Rates]]
		- ([[Interest Rate Differential]])
- Benefits & costs of globalisation
	- [[Global Contagion]] is a good negative

### [[Pattern Of Trade]]
use this when talking about australias imports & exports
- Expors & Imports
	- Accounts for 50% of GDP
	- Exports = 28%
	- Improts = 21%
	- *increased ovre time*
- Top three partners
	1. China
	2. Japan
	3. United States
- Main Exports
1. Iron Ore
2. Coal
3. Natural Gas
- Imports
	1. Refined petrol
	2. Motor Vehicles
	3. Freight
### [[Comparative Advantage]]
- Uses [[Production Possibility Frontier]]
- Example question:  country b has a comparative advantage in iron ore, it is 3x mroe efficient in iron ore, $80 \div 50$ it is much less comparatively advantaged in coal.
- When figuring the rate of exchange (in country A, 1 coal exchanges for 2 iron ore typa question)
	- Pick one in the middle, e.g. [[Terms of Trade]] if one country exchanges 1 coal for 4 iron ore, then 1 coal trades for **3** iron ore or 1 iron ore trades for **0.33** coal. #seminar-icons 
- We can use demand supply modelex to sshow exports & imports
	- When a coutnry **exports** the world price is above the domestic price, meaning quantity supplied is more than quantity demanded
		- Producer Surplus Increases
		- Consumer Surplus decreases
		- Total Surplus Increases
	- When a country **imports** the world price below domestic price, therefore domestic quantity supplied is less than domestic quantity demanded
		- Producer surplus decreases
		- Consumer Surplus increases
		- Total Surplus Increases
This means there is a net benefit either way, you talk about **both improts and exports** in a benefits of trade. #econs-seminar 
		- e.g. real income increases, etc.
### Protection - [[Tariffs]] & [[Subsidies]]
- Use the [[Demand and Supply Model]]
- Both cause [[Dead-Weight-Loss]]
- Arugments **for** protection;
	- Infant Industry
	- Dumping
	- Strategetic industries
		- like national defense
	- Diversification
- The Subsidy model
- Q1 to q2 is equal to amoutn of exports pre subsidy
- [[Excalidraw Subsidies.excalidraw]] <--- Practise this
### Balance of Payments
- The [[Current Account]] is the main one
	- The Current account is equal to [[Savings Investment Gap|Savings + Investment]]
- If the question involes [[Foreign Investment]] thats whe nwe talk about [[Financial Account]]
- Talk about **both** savings & Investment when talking about CAB

#### [[Balance of Trade|Trade Balance]]

- Write down **three examples** of australian commodities (our main export) 
	- see [[Composition of Trade]]
- Increases in commiditty pries -> increase value of exports -> increas the [[Balance of Trade|Trade Balance]].
- Commodity prices is a **cyclical factor** 
- If world economic growth increases (especially china), -> Increase in Exports & increase in [[Balance of Trade|Trade Balance]]
	- has something to do with China being a cyclical factor lmao) #econs-seminar  

Ceteris paribus;
- Increase in **Consumption** will cause imports to increase & **trade balance will decrease**
- Investment increase, imports will increase therefore **trade balance will decrease**
Cyclical Factors
- Australia's Growth rate is cyclical
- Movements in exchange rate is cyclical
Structural Factors
	- Affect Australia **Income Account**, linked to [[Foreign Investment]]

**review/revise cyclical and structural factors** #econs-seminar 

- [[Savings Investment Gap]]
	- If Investment is grater than Savings 100% do have deficit
	- obv opposite applies see, [[Current Account Balance#Calculating the *Current Account Balance*|this]] for proof of cab = S-I gap
- Reason for the CAB Surplus
	- COVID caused Recession
		- Savings Increases due to economic uncertainty
		- therefore, S was greater than I
		- Causing a CAB Surplus
- If Australia started to grow faster, Investment would rise, making Investment greater than Savings
	- Pushing us back to deficit
	- We are still in a CAB surplus for now, prob wont last

- Reasons for Trade Surplus
	- Record levels of Commodity Levels
	- Low Australia Dollar (~mid 60s)

- Key question: why does AUS have a Current Account Surplus #econs-seminar  ^^^ see above for why



- Why has the trade balance increased (See graph in paper)
	- Same reasons as Trade Surplus


- [[Balance of Income|Income Balance]]
	- Interest Payments
	- Dividend Payment
- Why has the income balane increased up to Sep 21
	- Economy is in **recession** therefore;
	- Companies do not pay out dividends to foreign investment
	- Incoem balance approaches zero as investment decreases due to low dividends.

- Why has the income b
- Sep 22 - Highest income deficit in Australia
	- This is *good*, since it represents investment

- Why is income balance always negative
	- Australia's Inflow of [[Foreign Investment]]
		- Results in [[Income Payments]]

- Trade balance overtook Incoem balance to create [[Savings Investment Gap]] giving CAS (double check)

### Review - 2022 exam
Part a, question, we are receiving money still.
- Recorded in financial account not current acount since we are selling a asset
Answer is c



- In the [[Terms of Trade]] graph;
	- Most Important category in the XPI: Commodities
		- Include top 4 [[Composition of Trade]]
	- Same for MPI
		- include top 4 from [[Composition of Trade]]

- Oil will affect Import Price Index 

Practise the Terms of Trade graph in the booklet #econs-seminar 

Why has terms of trade risen since 2020
- 48% rise in export prices from 2020 to 2023
- Rise in Import prices, but export prices rose a greater proportion

- Four factors effecting Terms of Trade
	- Commodity Prices <-- Obvious one (XPI Factor)

	- Could talk about oil prices (MPI factor)
	- Freight Prices (MPI Factor though maybe both)
	- Agriculture Price resulting from drought (MPI Factor)
	- Ukraine war (MPI Factor)
	- China Supply

- Four effects of a rise in the terms of trade
	- Appreciation of [[Exchange Rate]]
	- Increase in the [[Balance of Trade|Trade Balance]]
	- Increase Aggregate Demand (**why**)
	- Increase GDP/national income
An increase in the Terms of Trade is **very positive** for hte economy

#### Exchange Rate
- What has happened to the $AUD in relation to the [[Trade-Weighted Index]]
	- This is mostly gonna covcern, china, japan, and the euro, since they are the main currencies the TWI is weighted against, know them. #econs-seminar 
- Factors driving the $AUD
- Effects of a depreciation/appreciation


- March 2022 13% full, $US 0.75 -> TWI 63.6
- May 2023: $USD.0.65; TWI 60.1 6% against the TWI

- Sicne TWI is an average, its less volatile then the actual currency changes.
- something else abotu this
- refer to pics

- Imports Effect Supply, increase in improts causes a Shift to the right in the Supply Curve.
	- Include a fake number. e.g. $0.60 -> $0.65


- Simple questions show the shift on the curve that influences the dolalr changing.


Interest Rates on the Exchange Rate
- A fall in Australian Interest Rates ([[Interest Rate Differential]]), causing a fall in the Interest Rate Differential, moving **both of the curves** to shift.
	- This causes the Supply curve to shift to the right
		- There is more AUd in the market for some reason
	- Demand curve will shift to the left
		- less demand for investment since other countries are comparatively better.


- Why has the AUD fallen despite high commodity prices
	- Interest Rates in the US have risen much mroe than us
		- This causes the australai dolalr to depreciate since the [[Interest Rate Differential]] is big between us
	- 

##### Depreciation
- Is a high or low AUD good or bad
- It Depends; see [[Exchange Rate Effects]]


### Foreign Investment
The buying and selling of [[Financial Assets]].
- Includes;
- Debt & Equity
- Borrowling & Lending
- Assets
**Write Foreign Invesmtnet**, not Investment this could cause entire response to get 0 marks
- Investment refers to **capital ivnestment**, 
	- **an Increase in Interest Rates** decreases capital investment
- Where as in **foreign investment**
	- **an increase in interest rate** will cause an increase in f.i since there is greater returns (better [[Interest Rate Differential]])
- This differentiates them

Foreign Investment heavily relates to the [[Savings Investment Gap]]
Foreign Ivnestment benefits te econonomy by;
- Filling I-S gap
- Developing Aust's mining industry
- Promoting technology transfer
- Increasing real GDP and employment
- Increasing Aust's net wealth & living stds.

#### Foreign Ivnestments and the Balance of Payments
- [[Foreign Liabilities]] the sum of foreign ivnestments **coming out**
- [[Foreign Assets]] the sum of Foreign Investment **going out**
Foreign Liabilities is bigger.
[[Net Foreign Liabilities]] = $\text{Net Foreign Debt} + \text{Net Foreign Equity}$

See graph on booklet
- Net Foreign Liabilities has declined significantly recently
	- Net foreign equity is negative, therefore it's actually a **asset** (when negative is asset)

**revise Net foreign liabilities, mainly the terminology** #econs-seminar 


# Unit 4
All topics discussed.
- All models discussed obviously
- AD/AS model is the key model
- Extended answer probably going to beon;
	- AD/AS Model
	- Fiscal Policy
	- Monetary
	- something involving **the multiplier**
		- AE Model is best to show off **the multiplier**
- Structural Change & productivity is largely seperate to the others.

#### The Busienss Cycle
- Indicators of T.B.C;
	- GDP
	- Unemployment
		- Indicated by opposite of Real GDP, rising Real GDP indicates lowering Unemployment
	- Inflation
The AD/AS Model shows changes in all
COVID = biggest demand & supply shock in the past century
- The longest phase in the business cycle is the expansion phase.
- Current Phase: **Boom** (prob approaching peak)
	- Unemployment: <4% Below
		- We are beyond [[Full Employment]]
	- Inflation: High
		- Capacity of economy reached
	- GDP: 

- Lookign at Real GDP as a line graph, looks linear, as real gdp generally increases.
- Looking at % change in GDP shows us more detail into the business cycle


###### Key Indicators
- Real GDP growth rate
	- 2.3% (March 2023)
		- It is below target due to reaching economic capacity (not enough labour)
			- Will decrease further as economy slows.
- Inflation Rate
	- 7% (March 2023)
- Unemployment Rate
	- 3.5%
		- .5% below [[Full Employment]].
			- Likely to increase in the future as the economy slows.
- Cash Rate
	- 4.1%
- Exhcnage Rate
	- 0.66AUD/USD
		- Depends on com. prices. and **Interest Rate Differential** in the near future.

For Busienss Cycle Question: **AD/AS**
For Multiplier: **AE**
> Still practise showing either in both. they may ask to show multipler in AD/AS just to throw you off




### Aggregate Expenditure Model

- Equilibrium occurs where **Total Spending** = **Total Production**
	- If this is not true, then a change in inventorieso ccurs
- If spending < output, ivnentories increase & output will decrease.
- See [[Aggregate Expenditure|AE Components]]

The Multiplier
- Can be evaluated as $\Delta C \div \Delta Y$ 
- Or from the [[The Multiplier Effect|Multiplier Formula]].
- also can get the MPC from Multiplier  Value but subbing into equation

Effect of change on the AE Model
- If there is a change in **Real GDP**
	- There is a movement **along the AE Line**, there is no shift in the curve

### AD/AS Model
- AD is downwards sloping **because** AD/AS model includes the price level

- Factors of production
	- Labour
		- [[Productivity]]
	- Capital
		- Technology / Technological advancemenets
	- Costs of Production

- $Y_p$ is equal to Potential GDP
	- Write Unemployment of 4% near this point, since at this point it should be at [[Full Employment]] if we are at potential gdp, since potential gdp is meets standards of [[Sustainable Economic Growth]]
- Production Costs are not linked? #econs-seminar  <--- check that


#### Shifts on AD/AS Model
-  Iron ore prices increase
		- Usually, in most econoies SRAS decreases, as increased Iron ore prices means costs of production rises
		- In Australia manufacture is a much lesser proportion of GDP, Iron ore prices increase cause AD increase as our NX increases, since we sell lots of iron ore.
- Share prices fall
	- AD decreases (confidence fall in investors)
- Productivity Increase
	 - SRAS & LAS increase
- Govt. Investment Increases
	- AD increases

Government / Private Investment leads to increase in "Capital stock", which is linked to aggregat esupply. **thus all 3 curves move to the right**, since it improves capital stock, which therefore improves capital stock
	This is why "***investment is the driver of growth***"


Increase in AD:
	- Real GDP increase
	- Inflation Increase
	- Uenemloyment decrease


What is the effect of a derease in SAS
- Real gdp decrease
- Ifnlation Increase
- Unemloyment increase


- Recovery from recession results in;
- Massive increase in AD compoennts
- SRAS decrease
	- Oil price bottleneck
	- resultign in a SRAS decrease
	- look at minhs on elater #econs-seminar 

### Fiscal Policy

Tools of Fiscal Policy
- [[Federal Budget]]
	- Government Spending
	- [[Taxation]]
Objectives of Fisal Policy
- [[Full Employment]]
- [[Price Stability]]
- [[Sustainable Economic Growth]]
- [[Income Redistribution]]
Types of Fiscal Policy;
- [[L4 - Fiscally Stabilising the Econonomy|Discretionary Fiscal Policy]] - Deliberate changes in G&T
- [[L4 - Fiscally Stabilising the Econonomy|Automatic Stabilisers]] - Changes in G.S and Taxation due to [[The Business Cycle|Business Cycle]]

**must mention both of these**.



## Financing a Deficit
 ![[L3 - Budgets and Government Finance#Methods to Finance a Deficit (Boarba)|clean-shadow no-h]]
 Main method is: **1**; Selling government Bonds
 - The government can gain the revenue they need to spend.
 - Private Sector gets guarranteed bonds.
 - Government Pays Interest **but**
	 - Private Sector spends that as consumption, so is re-injected into the economy.
- (crowdingo ut is issue)


## The Budget Balance
- Usually around 25% <-- i think mabe heard that wrong (but looks accurate from graph)
- Giant red spike in the budget balance graph (on booklet) is due to COVID
- 2022/23 Surplus?????? <---- 
	- I Double checked, this si the predicated surplus for the curren tyear 2022/23
- We shuld have a massive surplus in 2022/23, but we have a very small surplus
	- This is due to bad fiscal policy, (excess government spending causing inflationary pressure)
- Why did spending increase so much in 2022-23
	- Mainly due to **Automatic Stabilisers**,
		- (could've reduced by cutting certain things? maybe) 

  

- Fiscal Policy can affect the SAS & LAS curve
- Increases in government investment increase the capital stock & shift the AS curve to the right
- An increase in govenrment spending on education & training will increase productivity & shift AS curve to the right
- Reducing income tax rates can increase the labour supply and shift the AS curves to the rigth.


### Monetary Policy
- Main tool of monetary Policy
	- [[Cash Rate]]
- Importance of [[Price Stability]]
	- Increases busienss consumer confidence
	- Promotoes certainty= increasign economic growth
	- promotes [[International Competiveness]]

Monetary Policy is go to Essay Question;
- Cash Rate from 0.1% in  April 2022 to 4.1% in june
- Contractionary Monetary Stance

Influence Aggregate Demand (**AD**) curve
1. Increases the cost of borrowing
2. Increase loan repayments
3. Decrease Asset Prices
	- Asset Prices have inverse relation to asset prices
4. Appreciate the exchange rate
	- [[Interest Rate Differential]]



Graph Desc:
When the economy is above potential GDP, Mon. Raises interest rates to decrease AD, thereby reducing inflation.

###### Exchange Rate / Interest Rates Relationship
The AUD exchange rate & the Itnerest Rate have a **very strong relationship**. 
- he said it "Rises instantly"
- Likely due to [[Interest Rate Differential]]


### Comparing Fiscal & Monetary Policy
- Whih policy is best to use to stbilise the business cycle?
	- Both
- Which policy works best in a contraction?
	- Fiscal
- Which policy works best in a boom?
	- Monetary
- Which policy is the most direcT?
	- Fiscal
- Which policy the most flexible?
	- Monetary
- Which policy hast eh shortest effect lag? 
	- Fiscal
- Which policy has the shorest decision lag?
	- Monetary

## Structural Change & Productiy
out of booklet graph, the most significant change is;
- Manufcturing 
	- 1981 = 14% of output
	- 2023 = 6% of Output
	- Due to : Aging population
- Services
	- Due to improvements in technology
- Mining
	- Due to Globalisation, and improvements in Technology

I guessed which ones apply to each specifically above ^^^, the oens on the slide are:
- Globalisation
- Technology
- Ageing population
- Climate Change

### Productivity
- Why is producitivty important
	- Its the main way to icnrease **real income** and **living standards**.
		- Only other things that can increase GDP per capita / **real income** (they're the same) is a favourable [[Terms of Trade]].

$$\frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Number of Hours worked}}$$
Use a simple example to show how productivity might change as a result of something?

Labour Productivity consists of;
1. Capital Deepening - Increases K/L Ratio
	- Capital Investment that gives worker capital to make them mroe productive
2. Multifactor productivity - improving qualtiy of lbour
	- Education, make people better at what they do.

Government can improve productivity b focusing on the above, by investment into stuff



### Questions
- Will producitivty shift both curves?
	- Productivity shifts both curves, and leads to higher real wages, 
		- (probably improves multilier effect since he said it will influence consumption in the long-run)
- Tax Reform will influence productivity, but not too much.)
