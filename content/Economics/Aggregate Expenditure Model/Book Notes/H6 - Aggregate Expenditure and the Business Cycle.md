The [[H4 - The Keynesian Aggregate Expenditure Model|Keynesian Aggregate Expenditure Model]] can be used to show the impact of a change in a component of AE (*C / I / G / X / M*)

**In both panels**, the blue line ($AE_f$) represents the Aggregate expenditure necessary to reach *Full employment*. each panel demonstrates either contraction or expansion where the line is either below, or above the line respectively.

##### Panel A
Shows the [[The Business Cycle#Contraction / Downswing|Contraction Phase]] of the business cycle.
The $AE_f$ line represents the necessary AE for full employment. In a *contraction*, it is lower than necessary.
The *gap between* what is necessary for full employment & current AE (green line) is the ***Deflationary gap***. 

> [!danger]- Archive version of Panel A
> The movement of the line down *represents* the needed aggregate expenditure to reach *full employment* decreasing.
> A ***Deflationary Gap*** is created as the *current* level of spending is **above what is necessary for *full employment***. 
> 	- Blue Line represents the AE necessary to *fully* employ *all resources* (including labour), it has an Equilibrium of $Y_f$
> 	- A Economic Contraction occurs (as happens in the *contraction phase*) 
> 	- The Full resource use line is multiplied down to $Y_d$
> 	This is because growth in *Real GDP* **slows** from $Y_f$ to $Y_d$ 

##### Panel B
Shows the [[The Business Cycle#Expansion / Upswing|Expansion Phase]] of the Business Cycle.
The Yellow line has a equilibrium of $Y_i$ which is higher than the necessary full employment level denoted by $Y_f$, meaning the economy has expanded too much, causing demand to push up prices (*inflation*)
A ***Inflationary Gap*** is created as the current AE is higher than that necessary for full employment.
