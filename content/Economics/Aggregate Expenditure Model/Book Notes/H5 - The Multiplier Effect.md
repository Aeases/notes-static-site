"New Expenditure" has far-reaching effects on aggregate levels of income since "one man's spending is another man's income". The Keynesian Theory of " The [[The Multiplier Effect]] explains this.

- Small changes in the [[Marginal Propensity]] have dramatic effects on the size of the multiplier.
- The Multiplier effect is always >1 unless MPC = 0
- The **Multiplier Effect** applies to any autonomous change in expenditure (**G1 Government spending**, investment, exports)

#### Example Economy
has three sectors, households, firms, and the financial sector.
$$\text{In this economy } AE = C + I$$
If this economy receives $10b investment in one industry;
- Industry employees more people
- Now employed households spend part of their income on goods & services including food, clothing, rent and entertainment.
- This flows throughout the entire [[Circular Flow Of Income]].

### Multiplier
This flow of income throughout the economy is what we refer to as the multiplier.
	e.g. increase in investment of $10b causes total income to rise by $25b, the multiplier is 2.5 since $25b is 2.5 more than $10b.

| Time Period            | Y  =             | C +              | S               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1 (Initial Investment) | 10               | 6                | +4.00           |
| 2                      | 6                | 3.60             | 2.40            |
| 3                      | 3.60             | 2.16             | 1.44            |
| 4                      | 2.16             | 1.30                 | 0.86            |
| Sum of periods         | $\sum Y = 21.76$ | $\sum C = 13.06$ | $\sum S = 8.70$ |
| After $\infty$ periods | $\sum Y=25$      | $\sum C = 15$    | $\sum S = 10$   |

To find the multiplier we can take the total amount of income generated by the
investment (After $\infty$ Time Periods |  $\sum Y = 25 = \Delta Y$) and divide it by the income the original investment introduced into the economy (Time Period 1 | $Y = 10 = \Delta I$).

#### Methods of calculating the Multiplier (k)
>[!abstract] Method 1
>$$\begin{aligned} 
>\Delta Y \div \Delta I = k
>\\  25 \div 10 = k
>\\ 2.5 =k
>\end{aligned}
>$$

>[!summary] Method 2 (and 2.5)
>If you do not have the end result, you can also use the [[Marginal Propensity|MPC / MPS]]
>[!question]
$$1 \div (1 - MPC) = k$$
OR
$$1 \div MPS = k$$

- The multiplier effect shows the effect of one persions spending on another's income. 
- An initial investment $10b creates new income
- Income that is spent creates new income for others in the following time period.
- Follow-on income is partially saved, those spent produuces even more income in the following time period.

### What if MPC increases?
An increase in Marginal Propensity to consume causes a reater "respending effect".
basically; **the multiplier from a given investment would be higher the more we consume**.
e.g. $$1 \div (1-0.60) = k=0.25 \text{ Whereas } 1 \div (1-0.75) = k = 4$$
- Small changes in the [[Marginal Propensity]] have dramatic effects on the size of the multiplier.
- The Multiplier effect is always >1 unless MPC = 0
- [[Marginal Propensity]] changes as a result of attitudes to spending and saving. It may change over time.
- The MPC is an average across all households in the economy

### Multiplier causes equilibrium income to increase greatly
- At Equilibrium Savings & Investment are equal (60)
- An increase in investment of 10 lifts up investment to point $60+10$ ($I + \Delta I$)
- $C+I$ function lifts up by $\Delta I$ as well, making it $C+I+ \Delta I$.
- Since the $C+I$ function increases by $\Delta I$ equilibrium income moves right

This diagram depicts the new equilibrium income, it will get there through "steps" towards equilibrium, each step to the right (increase in income) will come from a segment of the previous step's induced *income* according to the MPC, e.g. Initially $10, MPC of 60% means the next is $6, then $3.6 and so on. This can be seen in the diagram below

*ceteris paribus* it will aproach the new equilibrium income with every step.

>[!cite]+ Book Examples
The Multiplier process applies to any autonomous change in expenditure - which could be a change in investment, govenrment spending or exports. Examples include:
>- Resource projects in the Pilbara region of WA;
>- Government spending on new railways; or 
>- the increase in the Jobseker allowance during the pandemic
>
>It also applies to decreases in Autonomous spending like;
>- Closure of a bank in a rural town
>
>These would all have a ripple effect on other services. e.g. for the closure of a local bank, bank employees move, causing supermarket turnover, cafe sales, doctors visits, etcetera, all to fall.
>On A larger scale;
>- The [[Global Financial Crisis]] (2008-09)
>- Pandemic (2020)
>
>both cause a fall in investment spending and a fall in GDP which would induce the multiplier negatively.

### Other factors that influence **Multiplier** effect
- The Multiplier would equal infinity if the MPC was equal to one.
The multiplier is restricted by the size of leakages from;
- Savings
- Taxation
- Imports
Each of these leakages reduces the size of the multiplier.
The **multiplier** equation taking into account leakages is this;
$$k= 1 \div (MPS+MPT+MPM)$$
Where:
*$MPS$* = [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to save]]
*$MPT$* = [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to tax]]
*$MPM$* = [[Marginal Propensity|Marginal Propensity to import]]
e.g. $k = 1 \div (0.2+0.3+0.2) = 1.43$

The Multiplier in the Australian economy is on average **between 1.5 and 2.5** #econs-example
