## 1.2.1 - The relationship between GDP and aggregate expenditure.
**Gross Domestic Product** (GDP) refers to the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period.

There are two approaches to measuring GDP:
1. **Expenditure approach** -  The expenditure approach attempts to calculate GDP by evaluating the sum of all final good and services purchased in an economy.

2. **Income approach** - The income approach looks at the final income in the country.

In a macroeconomic equilibrium, **output = spending = income** where all income are spent on all goods and services produced. 
	- There is no tendency for change in equilibrium, a state of stability.
	- The free market is more instable, but will reach towards equilibrium through the **automatic adjustments of demand and supply**.
